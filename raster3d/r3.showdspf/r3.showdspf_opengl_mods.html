<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FF0000"><B>*** Disclaimer ***</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><BR>
</FONT>The porting effort from IrisGL to OpenGL was performed with the goal of just getting things to run with
OpenGL with some user-interface improvements.  Only a small attempt was made to correct for sloppy/dangerous coding
practices found in the <B>original</B> code.  Sloppy/dangerous coding practices were modified only when they resulted
in serious code errors (causing core dumps).  Certain files, such as new_init_graphics.c, which were totally new
files, were coded to higher standards.  In general, this effort was only a porting effort, <B>not</B> a re-architecting
effort.<BR>
