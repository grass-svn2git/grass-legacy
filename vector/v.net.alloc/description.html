<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.alloc</em> allocates subnets for nearest centres (direction from 
centre). Centre node must be opened (costs >= 0). Costs of centre node are 
used in calculation. Supported are cost assignments for both arcs and nodes, 
and also different in both directions of a vector line. For areas cost will 
be calculated along boundary lines.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Center nodes have to be assigned to vector nodes using <em>v.digit</em>. 
Nodes and arcs can be closed using cost = -1. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<em>Calculating subnets for 7 centre nodes using cost assigned to vector length
</em><br>
<b>v.net.alloc in=</b>vectmap <b>out=</b>vectmap.alloc <b>ccats=</b>1-7

<p>

<em>Calculating subnets for 7 centre nodes using cost assignments in both 
directions</em><br>
<b>v.net.alloc in=</b>vectmap <b>afcol=</b>INDEX <b>abcol=</b>INDEXBACK 
<b>out=</b>vectmap.alloc <b>ccats=</b>1-7
