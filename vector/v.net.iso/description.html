<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.iso</em> splits net to bands between cost isolines (direction from
centre). Centre node must be opened (costs >= 0). Costs of centre node are 
used in calculation. Supported are cost assignments for both arcs and nodes, 
and also different in both directions of a vector line. For areas cost will 
be calculated along boundary lines.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Center nodes have to be assigned to vector nodes. Nodes and arcs can be closed 
using cost = -1.
