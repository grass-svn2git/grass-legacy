<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.iso</em> splits net to bands between cost isolines (direction from
centre). Centre node must be opened (costs >= 0). Costs of centre node are 
used in calculation. Supported are cost assignments for both arcs and nodes, 
and also different in both directions of a vector line. For areas cost will 
be calculated along boundary lines.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Nodes must be on the isolines.<P>

Center nodes have to be assigned to vector nodes. Nodes and arcs can be closed 
using cost = -1. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Subdivision of a network into areas:<br>

The costs do not have to be stored in a DBMS table, it works with vector
line lengths if no costs are given. The map must contain at least one center
(point) on the vector network which can be patched into with
<a HREF="v.patch.html">v.patch</a>.

<pre>
v.net.iso input=streets output=isomap ccats=1 costs=1000,2000,5000
</pre>

that should cut network to 4 categories:

<pre>
cat | distance from point
1          0 - 1000
2       1000 - 2000
3       2000 - 5000
4            > 5000
</pre>

To see the result, run for example:

<pre>
d.vect isomap col=green  cats=1
d.vect isomap col=yellow cats=2
d.vect isomap col=orange cats=3
d.vect isomap col=red    cats=4
</pre>
