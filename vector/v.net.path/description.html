<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.path</em> can find shortest path(s) on the vector network.
Costs may be either line lengths, or attributes saved in a database 
table. These attributes values are taken as costs of whole segments. If read 
from the table, arcs' costs may be different in both directions.
Shortest paths are written to output vector file and attached attribute table.
<P>

Nodes can be piped into the program from file or from stdin. The
syntax is as follows:
<pre>
   id start_point_category end_point_category
</pre>

or

<pre>
   id start_point_x start_point_y end_point_x end_point_y
</pre>

Points specified by category must be exactly on network nodes,
while, when specifying coordinates, the next node to a given
coordinate pair is used.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

If the columns 'afcol', 'abcol' and 'ncol' costs are not
specified, the length of network segments is measured and 
zero costs are assumed for nodes.
<P>
When using attributes, the length of segments is not used. To get
more precise results, length should be taken indirectly into account
by attributes. For example, to get the <b>fastest path</b> the columns 
'max_speed' and 'length' are required. The correct fastest path can then 
be found by specifying <tt>afcol=length/max_speed</tt> (pg driver). If needed,
the line length can be calculated and written to the attributes table 
by <em>v.to.db</em>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Shortest path from node 9 to 12 (nlayer=1 if no extra table for nodes):

<pre>
    echo "1 9 12" | v.net.path network afcol=forward abcol=backward out=mypath nlayer=1
    d.vect mypath col=red
</pre>
