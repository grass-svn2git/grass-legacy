<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>s.perturb</EM>
reads a vector map of points and writes the same points but
<EM>perturbs</EM> the eastings and northings by
adding either a uniform or normal delta value. Perturbation means that
a variating spatial deviation is added to the coordinates.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The uniform distribution is always centered about zero.
The associated parameter is constrained to be positive and
specifies the maximum of the distribution; the minimum is
the negation of that parameter.

<P>

Usually, the mean (first parameter) of the normal
distribution is zero (i.e., the distribution is centered at
zero). The standard deviation (second parameter) is
naturally constrained to be positive.

<P>

Output sites are not guaranteed to be contained within the
current geographic region.
