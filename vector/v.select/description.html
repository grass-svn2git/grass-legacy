<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.select</em> allows the user to select features from a vector 
by features from another one.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Only features with category numbers will be considered. If required
the <em>v.category</em> module can be used to add them. Typically
boundaries do not need to be given a category number, as an area's
attributes are inherited from the centroid. Typically points, lines, and
centroids will always want to have a cat number.
<p>
e.g. take a road which separates two farms. It is ambiguous as to which
farm an attribute that is attached to the road belongs to. The boundary
only needs a cat number if it will hold its own attributes, such as road
name or pavement form. A centroid in each paddock holds the information
with respect to ownership, area, etc.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Extract forest fire points from larger fire map:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=fire binput=forest output=forest_fire
</pre></div>
<P>

Extract Italian rivers from VMAP0 watercourses map:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=watrcrsl_eurnasia_wgs84 binput=italy_area \
         output=watrcrsl_italy operator=overlap
</pre></div>
