<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.distance</EM> finds the nearest element in vector map
(<B>to</B>) for elements in vector map (<B>from</B>). Various
information about relation (distance, category, etc.) may be uploaded
to attribute table attached to first vector map or printed to
'stdout'.  A new vector map may be created where lines connecting
nearest points on features are written.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

If a nearest feature does not have a category, column is updated
to <B>null</B>.  This is true also for areas, which means for example,
that if point is in island (area WITHOUT
category), <EM>v.distance</EM> does not search for nearest area WITH
category, island is identified as nearest and category updated to
null.
<p>
The upload <B>column</B>(s) must already exist. Create one with <em>v.db.addcol</em>.
<p>
In lat-long location <em>v.distance</em> gives distances (<b>dist</b>
and <b>to_along</b>) in meters not in degrees calculated as geodesic
distances on a sphere.

<h2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<H3>Find nearest lines</H3>

Find <EM>nearest lines</EM> in vector map <B>ln</B> for points from
vector map <B>pnt</B> within the given threshold and write related
line categories to column <B>linecat</B> in attribute table attached
to vector map <B>pnt</B>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance from=pnt to=ln upload=cat column=linecat
</pre></div>

<H3>Find nearest area</H3>

For each point from vector map <B>pnt</B> find <EM>nearest area</EM>
from map <B>ar</B> within the given threshold and write the related
area categories to column <B>areacat</B> in attribute table attached
to vector map <B>pnt</B>. In case a point falls into a polygon area,
the distance is zero:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance from=pnt to=ar upload=cat column=areacat
</pre></div>

<H3>Create a new vector map</H3>

Create a new vector map which contains <EM>lines connecting nearest
features</EM> of maps <B>pnt</B> and map <B>ln</B>. The resulting
vector map can be used for example to connect points to a network as
needed for network analysis:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance -p from=pnt to=ln out=connections upload=dist column=dist
</pre></div>

<H3>Query information</H3>

Query information from selected point(s). <EM>v.distance</EM> takes
points from vector map as input instead of stdin. First new vector map
with query points, has to be created, then the map can be analysed:
<br>   

Create query map (if not present):

<div class="code"><pre>
echo "123456|654321|1" | v.in.ascii output=pnt
</pre></div>

Find nearest features:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance from=pnt to=map_to_query upload=cat col=somecol -p
</pre></div>

<H3>Point-in-polygon</H3>

Find <EM>area</EM> from vector map <B>ar</B> for each point from
vector map <B>pnt</B> in which the individual point falls into and
write the related area categories to column <B>areacat</B> into
attribute table attached to vector map <B>pnt</B>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance from=pnt to=ar dmax=0 upload=cat column=areacat
</pre></div>

<H3>Univariate statistics on results</H3>

Create a vector map containing connecting lines and investigate mean
distance to targets. An alternative solution is to use
the <tt>v.distance upload=dist</tt> option to upload distances into
the <i>bugs</i> vector directly, then run v.univar on that. Also note
you can upload two columns at a time, e.g. <tt>v.distance
upload=cat,dist column=nearest_id,dist_to_nr</tt>.

<div class="code"><pre>
# create working copy
g.copy vect=bugsites,bugs

# add new attribute column to hold nearest archsite category number
v.db.addcol map=bugs column="nrst_arch INTEGER"

v.distance from=bugs to=archsites to_type=point upload=to_attr \
  to_column=cat column=nrst_arch out=vdistance_vectors_raw

# we need to give the lines category numbers, create a table, and create
#  a column in that table to hold the distance data.
v.category vdistance_vectors_raw out=vdistance_vectors type=line op=add
g.remove v=vdistance_vectors_raw

v.db.addtable map=vdistance_vectors column="length DOUBLE"
v.to.db map=vdistance_vectors option=length column=length

# calculcate statistics. Use v.univar.sh for extended statistics.
v.univar vdistance_vectors column=length
</pre></div>

<H3>Print distance matrix</H3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.distance -pa from=archsites to=archsites upload=dist col=dist
</pre></div>

Note: Matrix-like output is enabled only for flag <EM>-a</EM> and one
given upload option.
