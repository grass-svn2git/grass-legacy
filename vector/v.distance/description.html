<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.distance</EM>
finds features from one vector (from=) feature to another vector (to=) nearest feature.
Various information about relation (distance, ...) may be uploaded to attribute
table attached to first vector map or printed to 'stdout'.
A new vector map may be created where lines connecting nearest points on features are written.
<P>


<h2>EXAMPLES</H2>

1) Find nearest lines in vector map <B>ln</B> for points from vector map
<B>pnt</B> within the given threshold and write related line categories to
column <B>linecat</B> in attribute table attached to vector map <B>pnt</B>:
<br>
<tt>v.distance from=pnt to=ln upload=cat column=linecat</tt>

<p>
2) For each point from vector map <B>pnt</B> find nearest area from map
<B>ar</B> within the given threshold and write the related area categories
to column <B>areacat</B> in attribute table attached to vector map
<B>pnt</B>. In case a point falls into a polygon area, the distance is zero:
<br>
<tt>v.distance from=pnt to=ar upload=cat column=areacat</tt>


<H2>NOTES</H2>
If nearest feature does not have a category, column is updated to <B>null</B>.
This is true also for areas, which means for example, that if point is in island
(area WITHOUT category), v.distance does not search for nearest area WITH category,
island is identified as nearest and category updated to null.
