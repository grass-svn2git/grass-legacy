<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>v.distance</EM>
finds for features from one vector (from=) nearest feature in another vector (to=).
Various informations about reation (distance, ...) may be uploaded to attribute
table attached to first vector or printed to stdout.
New vector may be created where line connecting nearest points on features are written.
<P>


<h2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Find nearest lines in vector <B>ln</B> for points from vector <B>pnt</B> and 
write line categories to column <B>linecat</B> in attribute table attached to pnt:
<br>
<tt>v.distance from=pnt to=ln upload=cat column=linecat</tt>

<p>
For each point from vector <B>pnt</B> find area from <B>ar</B> it is within and 
write area category to column <B>areacat</B> in attribute table attached to pnt:
<br>
<tt>v.distance from=pnt to=ar upload=cat column=areacat</tt>


<H2>NOTES</H2>
If nearest feature does not have a category, column is updated to <B>null</B>.
This is true also for areas, which means for example, that if point is in island
(area WITHOUT category), v.distance does not search for nearest area WITH category,
island is identified as nearest and category updated to null.
