<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.extract</em> allows a user to select vector objects from an existing 
vector map and creates a new map containing only the selected objects. 
Database tables can be queried with SQL statements, if a connection is
established. 
Dissolving (optional) is based on the output categories. If 2 adjacent
areas have the same output category, the boundary is removed.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Only features with a category number will be extracted. So if you want to 
extract boundaries (which are usually without category, as that information
is normally held in the area's centroid) you must first use 
<a HREF="v.category.html">v.category</a> to add them.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Extract areas by category number with dissolving</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract -d list=1,2,3,4 input=soils output=soil_groupa type=area new=1
</pre></div>

<p>
produces a new vector area file <em>soil_groupa</em> containing 'area'
boundaries from <em>soils</em> with area category numbers of 1 thru 4;  any
common boundaries are dissolved, and all areas of the new map will be
assigned category number 1.


<h3>Extract areas by category label with dissolving</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract -d list=Abc,Def1,12A,WWd input=soils output=soil_groupa type=area new=0
</pre></div>
<p>
produces a new vector area file <em>soil_groupa</em> containing 'area'
boundaries from <em>soils</em> with area category labels of Abc,Def1, 12A,WWd;
these labels correspond to numbers 1 thru 4 of <em>soils</em>.  Any common
boundaries are dissolved, all areas of the new map will be retain their
original category numbers 1 thru 4, in this case, since new was set to
0.

<h3>Extract areas to uniquely labeled area</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract input=soils output=soil_groupa type=area new=1 file=sample
</pre></div>
<p>

produces a new vector area file <em>soil_groupa</em> containing 'area'
boundaries from <em>soils</em>.  No common boundaries are dissolved, all areas
of the new map will be assigned category number 1.

<h3>Extract vectors with SQL</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract input=markveggy.shp output=markveggy.1 new=1 \
          where="(VEGTYPE = 'Wi') or (VEGTYPE = 'PS') or (PRIME_TYPE='Wi')"
</pre></div>
<p>

produces a new vector map with category label 1 if the SQL statement is
fulfilled.


<h3>Dissolving based on column attributes</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.reclass pol_italy out=pol_italy_recl_nam col=region
v.extract -d pol_italy_recl_nam out=pol_italy_regions
</pre></div>
<p>

produces a new vector map with common boundaries dissolved
if the attribute of the left and right polygon is identical.
