<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.build.polylines</em> builds polylines from the lines in a binary vector 
file. It outputs the polylines in either binary or ASCII vector format, and if 
requested, copies the attribute and category files from the original file.

A line is a single straight line segment defined by one start node, one end 
node and no other nodes. A polyline is also defined by one start node, one end 
node and no other nodes, but is made of two or more consecutive straight line 
segments. The connections between the constituent line segments of a polyline 
do not appear as nodes in the vector map.

Polylines provide the most appropriate representation of curved lines when it 
is important that nodes serve to define topology rather than geometry. Curved 
lines are usually digitized as polylines, but these are sometimes broken into 
their constituent straight line segments during conversion from one data 
format to another. v.build.polylines can be used to rebuild such broken 
polylines. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

For full functionality <i>v.build.polylines </i> requires <i>v.build</i> and 
<i>v.in.ascii </i>. 

<p>

If the lines that make up a polyline are of different types, then 
<i>v.build.polylines 

</i> will set the type from the first constituent line.  
<i>v.build.polylines </i> will issue a warning unless the flag <i>-q </i> has 
been set.  It is possible to keep a list of all such warnings by redirecting 
standard output to a file. 

<p>

If the lines that make up a polyline have different attribute values 
then <i>v.build.polylines </i> will set the attribute value of the polyline to 
that of the last line (this is the behaviour of  <i>v.build </i>, which is 
used to assign the attribute values).  

<p>

<i>v.build.polylines </i> correctly 
handles <i>input </i> maps containing lines, area edges and points.  Lines and 
area edges will be converted to polylines  of the desired type.  Areas 
are only guaranteed to be preserved if the  constituent lines of the polylines 
that define them are all area edges in  the input map. Points will remain 
points provided that <i>type </i> has been set to `source'.  It is possible to 
convert lines and area edges to points or vice versa, but this is rarely useful.
