<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.build.polylines</em> builds polylines from the lines in a binary vector file. 
<!-- ???? and copies the attribute and category files from the original file. -->
<P>
A line is a single straight line segment defined by one start node, one end 
node and no other nodes. A polyline is also defined by one start node, one end 
node and no other nodes, but is made of two or more consecutive straight line 
segments. The connections between the constituent line segments of a polyline 
do not appear as nodes in the vector map.
<P>
Polylines provide the most appropriate representation of curved lines when it 
is important that nodes serve to define topology rather than geometry. Curved 
lines are usually digitized as polylines, but these are sometimes broken into 
their constituent straight line segments during conversion from one data 
format to another. <em>v.build.polylines</em> can be used to rebuild such broken 
polylines. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>

<!-- begin untrue?? -->
If the lines that make up a polyline are of different types, then 
<i>v.build.polylines</i> will set the type from the first constituent line.  
<i>v.build.polylines </i> will issue a warning unless the flag <b>-q</b> has 
been set. It is possible to keep a list of all such warnings by redirecting 
standard output to a file. 
<!-- end untrue ??-->
<p>

If the lines that make up a polyline have different attribute values 
then <i>v.build.polylines</i> will set the attribute value of the polyline to 
that of the last line <!-- still true?? --> (this is the behaviour of 
<i>v.build</i>, which is used to assign the attribute values). <!-- untrue?? -->

<p>
<i>v.build.polylines</i> correctly 
handles <b>input</b> maps containing lines, area edges and points. Lines and 
area edges will be converted to polylines of the desired type.  Areas 
are only guaranteed to be preserved if the  constituent lines of the polylines 
that define them are all area edges in the input map.

<!-- Points will remain points provided that <b>type</b> has been set to `source'.
It is possible to convert lines and area edges to points or vice versa, but this 
is rarely useful.   [type no longer exists, other behaviour still true??] -->
