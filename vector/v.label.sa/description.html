<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.label.sa</EM> makes a label-file from a GRASS vector map
with labels created from attributes in the attached table. The labels are
placed in as optimal place as possible. The label file has the same syntax
as the one created by <A HREF="v.label.html">v.label</A>

<H2>NOTES</H2>
This module is an implementation of "A General Cartographic Labeling
Algorithm" by Edmondson, Christensen, Marks and Shieber, 1996. The algorithm
works by the principle of Simulated Annealing.
