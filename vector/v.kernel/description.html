<H2>NOTES</H2>

The <em>mult</em> option is needed to overcome the limitation that
the resulting density in case of a vector map output is stored as category
(Integer). The density result stored as category may be multiplied by this number.
<P>
With the <em>-o</em> flag (experimental) the command tries to calculate an 
optimal standard deviation. The value of <em>stddeviation</em> is taken 
as maximum value. Standard deviation is calculated using ALL points, 
not just those in the current region.


<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>
The modules only considers the presence of point, but not 
(yet) any attribute values.
