<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.build</em> builds GRASS support files for (binary)
GRASS vector data files.  These support files supply
topology and category information that are needed by other
GRASS programs

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.build</em> creates support files only for binary
vector files located in the user's current mapset. If binary file 
is located in another mapset, you need to specify this.
