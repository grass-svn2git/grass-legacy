<h2>Vector data processing in GRASS GIS</h2>

<h3>Vector import</h3>

The <a href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a> module offers a common
interface for many different vector formats. Additionally, it
offers options such as on-the-fly creation of new locations or extension of
the default region to match the extent of the imported vector map.
For special cases, other import modules are available, e.g.
<a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> for input from a text file 
containing coordinate and attribute data, and 
<a href="v.in.db.html">v.in.db</a> for input from a database containing 
coordinate and attribute data.

<h3>Vector map operations</h3>

GRASS vector map processing is always performed on the full map.
If this is not desired, the input map has to be clipped to the
current region beforehand (<a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a>,
<a href="v.overlay.html">v.overlay</a>,<a href="v.select.html">v.select</a>).

<h3>Vector model and topology</h3>

GRASS is a topological GIS which helps to produce and maintain vector
maps with clean geometry. The following vector objects are available:

<ul>
<li> point: a point
<li> line: a sequence of vertices connected by line(s) with two endpoints called nodes
<li> boundary: the border line of an area
<li> centroid: the label point of an area
<li> area: the topological composition of centroid and boundary
<li> face: a 3D area
<li> kernel: a 3D centroid in a volume (not yet implemented)
<li> volume: a 3D corpus (not yet implemented)
</ul>

The <a href="v.type.html">v.type</a> module can be used to convert between
vector types if possible. The <a href="v.build.html">v.build</a> module is
used to identify topological errors. It allows to optionally extract the
erroneous vector objects into a separate map. Topological errors can be
corrected either manually within <a href="v.digit.html">v.digit</a> or,
to some extent, automatically in <a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a>.

Adjacent polygons can be found by <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>
(see 'sides' option).

<h3>Attribute management</h3>

GRASS can be linked to one or many database management systems (DBMS).
The <em>db.*</em> set of commands provides basic SQL support for
attribute management, while the <em>v.db.*</em> set of commands operates
on the vector map.

<ul>
<li><b>Category:</b> The category number is the vector ID. It is used to
     link attribute(s) to each vector object. The category number is stored
     within the geometry file for each vector object. Using
     <a href="v.category.html">v.category</a> the category numbers can be printed
     or maintained.
<li><b>Layers:</b> It is possible to link a vector object to one or several tables.
     By default the first layer is active, i.e. the first table corresponds to the
     first layer. Further tables are linked to subsequent layers. Using 
     <a href="v.db.connect.html">v.db.connect</a> layers can be listed or maintained.
<li><b>SQL support:</b> The DBF driver provides only very limited SQL support (as 
     DBF is not an SQL DB) while the other DBMS backends (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL etc)
     provide full SQL support since the SQL commands are sent directly to the DBMI.
     SQL commands can be directly executed with <a href="db.execute.html">db.execute</a>,
     <a href="db.select.html">db.select</a> and the other db.* modules.
</ul>

When creating vector maps from scratch, in general an attribute table must be created and
the table must be populated with one row per category (using <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>).
However, this can be performed in a single step using <a href="v.db.addtable.html">v.db.addtable</a>
along with the definition of table column types.

<h3>Editing vector attributes</h3>

To manually edit attributes of a table, the map has to be
queried in 'edit mode' using <a href="d.what.vect.html">d.what.vect</a>.
To bulk process attributes, it is recommended to use SQL.
