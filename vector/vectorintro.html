<h2>Vector data processing in GRASS GIS</h2>

<h3>Vector import</h3>

The module <a href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a> offers a common
interface for many different vector formats. Additionally, it also
offers options such as on-the-fly location creation or extension of
the default region to match the extent of the imported vector map.
For special cases, other import modules are available. Always the full
map is imported.

<h3>Vector map operations</h3>

GRASS vector map processing is always performed on the full map.
If this is not desired, the input map has to be clipped to the
current region beforehand (<a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a>,
<a href="v.overlay.html">v.overlay</a>,<a href="v.select.html">v.select</a>).

<h3>Vector model</h3>

GRASS is a topological GIS which helps to produce and maintain vector
maps with clean geometry. The following vector objects are available:

<ul>
<li> point: a point
<li> line: a sequence of vertices connected by line(s) with two endpoints called nodes
<li> boundary: the border line of an area
<li> centroid: the label point of an area
<li> area: the topological composition of centroid and boundary
<li> face: a 3D area
<li> kernel: a 3D centroid in a volume (not yet implemented)
<li> volume: a 3D corpus (not yet implemented)
</ul>

The <a href="v.type.html">v.type</a> module can be used to convert between
vector types if possible. The <a href="v.build.html">v.build</a> module is
used to identify topological errors which can be corrected either manually
in <a href="v.digit.html">v.digit</a> or, to some extend, automatically
in <a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a>.

<h3>Attribute management</h3>

GRASS can be linked to one or many database management systems (DBMS).
The <em>db.*</em> set of commands provides basic SQL support for
attribute management, while the <em>v.db.*</em> set of commands operates
on the vector map.

<ul>
<li><b>Category:</b> The category number is the vector ID. It is used to
     link attribute(s) to each vector object.
<li><b>Layers:</b> It is possible to link a vector object to several tables.
     The first table corresponds to the first layer. Further tables
     are linked to subsequent layers.
<li><b>SQL support:</b> The DBF driver provides only very limited SQL support (as 
     DBF is not an SQL DB) while the other DBMS backends (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL etc)
     provide full SQL support since the SQL commands are sent directly to the DBMI.
</ul>
