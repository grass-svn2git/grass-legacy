<h2>Vector data processing in GRASS GIS</h2>

<h3>Vector import</h3>

The <a href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a> module offers a common
interface for many different vector formats. Additionally, it
offers options such as on-the-fly creation of new locations or extension of
the default region to match the extent of the imported vector map.
For special cases, other import modules are available, e.g.
<a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> for input from a text file 
containing coordinate and attribute data, and 
<a href="v.in.db.html">v.in.db</a> for input from a database containing 
coordinate and attribute data.

<h3>Vector map operations</h3>

GRASS vector map processing is always performed on the full map.
If this is not desired, the input map has to be clipped to the
current region beforehand (<a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a>,
<a href="v.overlay.html">v.overlay</a>,<a href="v.select.html">v.select</a>).

<h3>Vector model and topology</h3>

GRASS is a topological GIS. This means that adjacent geographic
components in a single vector file are related. For example in a
non-topological GIS if two areas shared a common border that border
would be digitized two times and also stored in duplicate. In a
topological GIS this border exists once and is shared between two
areas.  Topological represenation of vector data helps to produce and
maintain vector maps with clean geometry as well as enables certain
analyses that can not be conducted with non-topological or spaghetti
data. In GRASS topological data are refered to as level 2 data and
spaghetti data is referred to as level 1.
<p>
Sometimes topology is not necessary and the additional memory and
space requirements are burdensome to a particular task. Therefore two
modules allow for working level 1 (non-topological) data within
GRASS. The <a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> module allows
users to input points without building topology. This is very useful
for large files where memory restrictions may cause difficulties. The
other module which works with level 1 data is

<a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a> which enables spatial
approximation and topographic analysis from a point or isoline file.

<p> In GRASS, the following vector objects are available:

<ul>
<li> <b>point:</b> a point</li>
<li> <b>line:</b> a sequence of vertices connected by line(s) with two endpoints</li>
     called nodes</li>
<li> <b>boundary:</b> the border line of an area</li>
<li> <b>centroid:</b> the label point of an area</li>
<li> <b>area:</b> the topological composition of centroid and boundary</li>
<li> <b>face:</b> a 3D area</li>
<li> <b>kernel:</b> a 3D centroid in a volume (not yet implemented)</li>
<li> <b>volume:</b> a 3D corpus (not yet implemented)</li>
</ul>

The <a href="v.type.html">v.type</a> module can be used to convert between
vector types if possible. The <a href="v.build.html">v.build</a> module is
used to identify topological errors. It allows to optionally extract the
erroneous vector objects into a separate map. Topological errors can be
corrected either manually within <a href="v.digit.html">v.digit</a> or,
to some extent, automatically in <a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a>.

Adjacent polygons can be found by <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>
(see 'sides' option).

<h3>Attribute management</h3>

GRASS can be linked to one or many database management systems (DBMS).
The <em>db.*</em> set of commands provides basic SQL support for
attribute management, while the <em>v.db.*</em> set of commands operates
on the vector map.

<ul>
<li><b>Categories:</b> The category number is the vector ID. It is
used to link attribute(s) to each vector object. A vector object can
have zero, one, two, or more categories. The category number is stored
within the geometry file for each vector object. Using 
<a href="v.category.html">v.category</a> the category numbers can be
printed or maintained.</li>

<li><b>Layers:</b> It is possible to link the geographic objects in
one vector file to one or more tables. Each link to a distinct
attribute table is called a layer. GRASS layers do not contain any
geographic objects, but consist of links to attribute tables in which
vector objects can have zero or more categories. If a vector object
has zero categories in a layer, then it does not appear in that
layer. In this fasion some vector objects may appear in some layers
but not in others. The practical benefit of this system is that it
allows placement of thematically distinct but topologically related
objects in a single file (e.g. forests and lakes). These virtual
layers also are useful for linking time series attribute data to a
series of locations that did not change over time. By default the
first layer is active, i.e. the first table corresponds to the first
layer. Further tables are linked to subsequent layers.  Using
<a href="v.db.connect.html">v.db.connect</a> layers can be listed or
maintained.</li>

<li><b>SQL support:</b> The DBF driver provides only very limited SQL
support (as DBF is not an SQL DB) while the other DBMS backends (such
as PostgreSQL, MySQL etc) provide full SQL support since the SQL
commands are sent directly to the DBMI. SQL commands can be directly
executed with <a href="db.execute.html">db.execute</a>,
<a href="db.select.html">db.select</a> and the other db.* modules.
</li>
</ul>

When creating vector maps from scratch, in general an attribute table must be created and
the table must be populated with one row per category (using <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>).
However, this can be performed in a single step using <a href="v.db.addtable.html">v.db.addtable</a>
along with the definition of table column types.

<h3>Editing vector attributes</h3>

To manually edit attributes of a table, the map has to be
queried in 'edit mode' using <a href="d.what.vect.html">d.what.vect</a>.
To bulk process attributes, it is recommended to use SQL
(<a href="db.execute.html">db.execute</a>).

<h3>Vector network analysis</h3>

GRASS provides support for vector network analysis. The following algorithms
are implemented:

<ul>
<li> Vector maintenance: <a href="v.net.html">v.net</a></li>
<li> Shortest path: <a href="d.path.html">d.path</a> and 
     <a href="v.net.path.html">v.net.path</a></li>
<li> Traveling salesman (round trip): <a href="v.net.salesman.html">v.net.salesman</a></li>
<li> Allocation of sources (create subnetworks, e.g. police station zones):
     <a href="v.net.alloc.html">v.net.alloc</a></li>
<li> Minimum Steiner trees (star-like connections, e.g. broadband cable 
     connections): <a href="v.net.steiner.html">v.net.steiner</a></li>
<li> Iso-distances (from centers): <a href="v.net.iso.html">v.net.iso</a></li>
</ul>
