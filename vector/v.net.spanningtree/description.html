<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.spanningtree</em> find the minimum spanning tree in a network. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Spanning tree is a minimum cost subnetwork connecting all nodes in a network. Or, if a network is disconnected then the module computes the minimum spanning tree for each (weakly) connected component. So, strictly speaking, module does not compute spanning tree but a spanning forest. As the name suggests spanning tree is a tree. That is, it contains no cycles and if a component has N nodes that the tree has N-1 edges and connected all nodes. <b>Accol</b> is used to specify the costs of the edges. The <b>output</b> consists of the edges in the spanning tree.  

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Find cheapest set of pipelines connecting all nodes.
