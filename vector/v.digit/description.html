<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.digit</em> is a vector map digitizer with graphical user interface.
Attribute tables can be directly generated while digitizing (define in
"Settings" first).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <b>bgcmd</b> is intended to be used for d.* commands.  Several
display commands rendering the digitize background may be used, they
have to separated by ';'. If the d.* command contains spaces the whole
command has to be be quoted (see example).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<tt>
d.mon x0<br>
d.rast name_of_raster #just to look at and to zoom into the area of interest <br>
</tt>

<p>
<b>1)</b> Digitizing an area based on a existing raster map, a vector
map will be created<br>
<p>
<tt>v.digit -n map=name_of_new_vector_map bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_raster"</tt><br>
<p>
The flag "-n" specifies that your vector map does not exist yet and
will be created with the name given by "map=". "bgcmd=" specifies a
display ("d.*") command and is set into quotes because it contains a
space.
<p>
The v.digit GUI appears -- after exiting v.digit GUI the vector map
"name_of_new_vector_map" exists. After leaving <em>v.digit</em>, run:
<p>
<tt>d.erase # to clear the monitor<br>
d.vect "name_of_new_vector_map" 
# the newly created vector should appear in the monitor</tt><br>
<p>

<b>2)</b> Digitizing a new vector and using the first vector and the
raster image as background<br>
<p>
<tt>
d.erase # clear monitor<br>
v.digit -n map=name_of_second_vector bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_your_raster;
d.vect=name_of_new_vector_map"</tt><br>
<p>
The v.digit GUI appears and the layer defined in the "bgcmd=" settings are 
displayed in the background. The "bgcmd=" settings have to be seen as a 
series of commands separated with ";", therefore the last command "d.vect" 
displays the previously created vector on top of the raster image. <br>
<p>

<b>3)</b> Digitizing a raster map and using a previously created
vector map as base which is displayed in the background as well:<br>
<p>
<tt>v.digit  map=name_of_new_vector_map bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_your_raster; 
d.vect=name_of_new_vector_map"</tt>
