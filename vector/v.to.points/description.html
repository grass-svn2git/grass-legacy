<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.to.points</em> creates points along input lines. The output is a vector with 2 layers.
Layer 1 holds the category and attributes of the input lines; all points created along the
same line have the same category, equal to the category of that line. In layer 2 each point
has it's unique category; other attributes stored in layer 2 are <em>lcat</em> - the
category of the input line and <em>along</em> - the distance from line's start.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>dmax</em> parameter is the maximum limit but not an exact
distance. To place points with exact distance from the beginning
of the vector line the user should use
<a HREF="v.segment.html">v.segment</a>.

<p>
To get points created for the beginning, middle and end only, use
the -i switch and set <em>dmax</em> so that:
<p>
(length of input line / 2) <= <em>dmax</em> <= length of input line
<p>
So if <em>dmax</em> is between 0.5x and 1.0x the line length, you
will always get points created at exactly the beginning, middle and
end of the input line.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

In this example, the 't_powerlines' vector lines map in the
<a HREF="http://grass.itc.it/download/data6.php">Spearfish 6.0</a>
location is used to create points along the input lines:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.to.points in=t_powerlines out=t_powerlines_points dmax=120
d.vect t_powerlines_points
</pre></div>
