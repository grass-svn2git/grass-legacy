/* Pruning of boundaries MUST NOT destroy topology of areas. This is guaranteed by 3 rules:
 *
 * 1) first and lst segment of the boundary is never changed
 * 
 * 2) if pruned boundary would cross another boundary, pruning is not done
 *    (original boundary is left unchanged)
 *
 * 3) position of centroids on the left and right side is checked and pruning
 *    is not done if centroid would be attached to another area
