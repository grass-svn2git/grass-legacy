<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.lidar.correction</em> is the last of three step to filter LIDAR
data. It makes a comparison between the LIDAR observations and an
interpolated surface in which only terrain points have been used. Once
the new reference surface is obtained, a point reclassification is
done:

<br><br>
<b>a)</b> Points classified as TERRAIN differing more than a threshold
    value are interpreted and reclassified as OBJECT.
<br>
<b>b)</b> Points classified as OBJECT and closed enough to the
    interpolated surface are interpreted and reclassified as TERRAIN.
<br><br>

The input should be the output of <em>v.lidar.growing</em> module or
the output of this <em>v.lidar.correction</em> itself. That means,
this module could be applied more times (although, two are enough) for
a better filter solution. The outputs are a vector map with a final
point classification as as TERRAIN SINGLE PULSE, TERRAIN DOUBLE PULSE,
OBJECT SINGLE PULSE or OBJECT DOUBLE PULSE; and an vector map with
only the points classified as TERRAIN SINGLE PULSE or TERRAIN DOUBLE
PULSE.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The final result of the whole procedure (v.lidar.edgedetection,
v.lidar.growing, v.lidar.correction) will be a point classification in
four categories:
<br>
TERRAIN SINGLE PULSE
<br>
TERRAIN DOUBLE PULSE
<br>
OBJECT SINGLE PULSE
<br>
OBJECT DOUBLE PULSE
<br>
