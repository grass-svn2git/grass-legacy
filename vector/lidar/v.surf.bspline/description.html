<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>v.surf.bspline</em> makes a bilinear/bicubic spline interpolation 
with Tykhonov regularization. The required input is an only 3d points 
vector map that will be used to interpolate a reference surface. 
<br>
<br>
Interpolation is carried out by adjusting a Least-Squares (LS) system 
in which the parameters to estime are spline functions. The number of 
splines doesn't depend on the resolution region, but it depends on the 
spline steps values in the north-south and west-east directions. These 
spline steps are set by "<b><i>sin=</i></b>" and "<b><i>sie=</i></b>", 
respectively. If the number of splines is bigger than the number of 
points, the LS system is bad conditioned because there are more unkowns 
than observations. In that case the LS normal matrix can't be inverted. 
To allow the inversion of the normal matrix a Tykhonov regularization 
is done. The minimizing function is the gradient in the case of a bilinear 
interpolation, and the curvature in the bicubic interpolation. The 
lambda_i parameter associated with the regularization smooths the 
interpolation. The higher the lambda_i parameter, the smoother the 
interpolation.
<br>
<br>
The number of splines has a great influence on two things, mainly. The
first thing is the module's execution time. The second is the RAM use. 
The higher the number of splines, the longer the time of execution and 
the higher RAM use. A numerical example: 100 splines in each direction 
imply 10e4 splines in total, that is, a square LS normal matrix of 10e4 
size. Inverting this matrix means inverting 100 millions elements! 
To improve this problems a Tcholebsky method with triangulars matrixes 
is used in the normal matrix inversion. It has also fixed a maximum number 
of splines for each direction. However, it is also possible running the 
module with a higher number of splines. For a number of spline higher than 
the fixed maximum, the whole region is divided into smaller regions. Each 
subregion is 150x150 splines wide. To avoid contour problems, the subregions 
are overlaped one to each other. To estimate a single value within the 
overlaped zones, a weighted mean considering the point positions into each
subregion is carried out.
<br>
<br>
The required input is a 3d points vector. If nothing is specified z-coordinates
will be used in the interpolation. It could be also possible to consider 
an attribure value by specifying "<b><i>layer=</i></b>" and "<b><i>column=</i></b>" 
parameters. If a vector map with another type of features is used, only 
points will be considered. If the "<b><i>input_ext=</i></b>" vector is 
used, the "<b><i>input=</i></b>" vector map will be used to create a 
reference surface. This surface will be used to make an estimation on the 
points within the "<b><i>input_ext=</i></b>". In this case a vector output 
("<b><i>output=</i></b>") must be specify. If the "<b><i>input_ext=</i></b>" 
is not supplied, the final interpolation output will be the interpolated 
reference surface from the "<b><i>input=</i></b>" vector map. In this case, 
one of both the raster or vector output format can be choosen. For raster 
format ("<b><i>raster_out=</i></b>"), the point estimation will be done 
on a regular grid with a resolution equal to the GRASS region. For vector 
format, the estimation will be done on the sparse points of the 
"<b><i>input=</i></b>" vector supplied. Both, vector and raster output, 
are not allowed simultaneously.
<br>
<br>
A cross validation method has been implemented. It helps to find the optimal 
lambda_i value that fits the data. It shows the <i>mean</i> and <i>rms</i> 
of the residuals from the true point value and the estimated from the 
interpolation made with all the data without the point itself. This procedure 
is done for fixed lambda_i values. The results of the cross validation will 
appear in the stdout and no vector nor raster output will be created. The 
external input ("<b><i>input_ext=</i></b>") will be not considered. Due to 
the nature of the algorithm, it is advised the user no to try the cross-
validation with more than 100 points at a time because it will take too long. 
The execution time could be reduced by considering a lower number of splines.
Although, as seen, it is possible to use a high number of splines, more than 
150x150 splines is not recommended.
<br>
<br>
In a raster map output ("<b><i>raster_out=</i></b>"), region resolution implying 
more than 2000x2000 (4 mill) cells are not allowed. If the user tries with a 
more than those cells an error message will ask for a lower region resolution.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h4>Basic interpolation</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector output=interpolate_surface type=bicubic
</pre></div>

In this case, a bicubic spline interpolation will be done and an
estimation on the points of point_vector will be the output.

<h4>Basic interpolation and raster output with a long spline step</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector raster_out=interpolate_surface sie=25 sin=25
</pre></div>

Now, a bilinear spline interpolation will be done on a grid. The spline steps
are set to 25. It doesn't mean that the grid will have a resolution equal to 25, 
but that each 25 units there will be a spline. 

<h4> Estimation of lambda_i parameter with a cross validation proccess</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline -c input=point_vector 
</pre></div>


<h4>Estimation on sparse points</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector int_ext=sparse_points output=interpolate_surface
</pre></div>

In this last case, an estimation on the points of the sparse_points vector
will be done. The reference surface used for this estimation will be that
interpolated using the point_vector vector.

<h4>Using attribute values instead Z-coordinates</h4>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector raster_out=interpolate_surface layer=1 column=attrib_column
</pre></div>

This last case, the module uses the attribute values in attrib_column 
in the table associated to layer 1.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
Known issues:
<br>
<br>
In order to avoid RAM memory problems, an auxiliar table will be needed for 
recording some intermediate calculi. Since the "<b>GROUP BY</b>" SQL function, 
which is not supported by the "<b>dbf</b>" driver, is used this driver is not 
allowed with the vector map output "<b><i>output=</i></b>". There is no problem
with the raster map output.
<br>
<br>
At this time, using the external vector input ("<b><i>input_ext=</i></b>") implies 
interpoling with Z-coordinates. Updates to allow using attribute values
will be done in a near future (I hope).
