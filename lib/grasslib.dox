<h2>GRASS 6 Programmer's Manual</h2>

GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is an open source,
Free Software Geographical Information System (GIS) with raster, topological
vector, image processing, and graphics production functionality that
operates on various platforms through a graphical user interface and shell
in X-Window. It is released under GNU General Public License (GPL).

This manual introduces the reader to the <i>Geographic Resources Analysis 
Support System</i> from the programming perspective. Design theory, system
support libraries, system maintenance, and system enhancement are all 
presented. Standard GRASS 4.x conventions are still used in much of the
code. This work is part of ongoing research being performed by the 
GRASS Development Team coordinated at <a href="http://mpa.itc.it/">ITC-irst</a>, Trento, Italy), 
an international team of programmers,
GRASS module authors are cited within their module's source code and the 
contributed manual pages.

<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li> GRASS-SWIG interface: \ref GRASS_SWIG_interface
</ul>

<h3>File structure of GRASS Location</h3>

A GRASS <b>raster map</b> consists of several files in several subdirectories in a mapset,
organized as follows:

<ul>
<li> <b>cellhd/</b>:
  map header including projection code, coordinates representing
  the spatial extent of the raster map, number of rows and columns, resolution, 
  and information about map compression;</li>
<li> <b>cell/, fcell/ or grid3/</b>:
  generic matrix of values in a compressed, portable
  format which depends on the raster data type (integer, floating point or 3D grid);</li>
<li> <b>hist/</b>:
  history file which contains metadata such as the data source,
  the command that was used to generate the raster map, or
  other information provided by the user;</li>
<li> <b>cats/</b>: 
  optional category file which contains text or numeric labels assigned
  to the raster map categories;</li>
<li> <b>colr/</b>: 
  optional color table;</li>
<li> <b>cell_misc/</b>: 
  optional timestamp, range of values, quantization rules (for floating point maps)
  and null (no-data) files; </li>
</ul>

GRASS <b>vector maps</b> are stored in several separate files in a single
directory. While the attributes are stored in either a DBF file, a SQLite file
or in an external DBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, ODBC), the geometric data are saved
as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>head</b>: vector map ASCII header with information about the map creation
  (date and name), its scale and threshold;</li>
<li><b>coor</b>: binary geometry file which includes the coordinates of graphic
  elements (primitives) that define the vector feature;</li>
<li><b>topo</b>: binary topology file describes the spatial relationships between the
  map's graphic elements;</li>
<li><b>hist</b>: history ASCII file with complete commands that were used to
  create the vector map, as well as the name and date/time of the map
  creation;</li>
<li><b>cidx</b>: binary category index file which is used to link the vector
  object IDs to the attribute table rows;</li>
<li><b>dbln</b>: ASCII file which contains definition(s) of link to attribute
  storage in database (DBMS).</li>
</ul>
