 \brief Snap all lines to existing vertex in threshold.

 Snap all lines to existing vertices.

 Warning: Lines are not necessarily snapped to nearest vertex, but to vertex in threshold! 

 Lines showing how vertices were snapped may be optionaly written to error map. 
 Input map must be opened on level 2 for update at least on GV_BUILD_BASE.

 \param Map input map where verices will be snapped
 \param type type of line to be snap
 \param thresh threshold in which snap vertices
 \param Err vector map where lines representing snap are written or NULL
 \param msgout file pointer where messages will be written or NULL
 \return

/* As mentioned above, lines are not necessarily snapped to nearest vertex! For example:
     |                    
     | 1         line 3 is snapped to line 1,
     |           then line 2 is not snapped to common node at lines 1 and 3,
                 because it is already outside of threshold
