\section intro Introduction

This describtion covers the new GRASS 5.7 vector library architecture.
This new architecture overcomes the vector limitations of GRASS 4.x-5.0 by
extending the vector support with attributes stored in external relational
databases and by new 3D capabilities. Besides internal file based storage the
geometry may alternatively be stored in PostGIS database. This enables users
to maintain large data sets with simultaneous write access. External GIS
formats such as SHAPE-files may be used directly without necessity of format
conversion.

\section background Background

In GIS the vector data model is used for geographic phenomena which may be
represented by geometric entities (primitives) like points, lines, and
areas. In GRASS 5.7 the vector data model includes the description of
topology, where besides the coordinates describing the location of the
points, lines, boundaries and centroids also their spatial relations are
stored. In general topological GIS require a data structure, where common
boundary between two adjacent areas is stored as a single line, simplifying
the map maintenance.

\section libraries Libraries

Besides internal library functions there are two main libraries:

\subsection vlib Vlib (Vector library)

For details please read Blazek et al. 2002 (see below) as well as the
references in this document.

The Vect_*() functions are the programmer's API for GRASS 5.7 vector
programming. See details here:

\subsection dglib DGLib (Directed Graph Library)

The Directed Graph Library or DGLib (Micarelli 2002,
http://grass.itc.it/dglib/) provides functionality for vector network
analysis. This library released under GPL is hosted by the GRASS project (in
the CVS server within the GRASS 5.7 source code). As stand-alone library it
may also be used by other software project.

The Directed Graph Library library provides functionality to assign costs to
lines and/or nodes. That means that costs can be accumulated while traveling
along polylines. The user can assign individual costs to all lines and/or
nodes of a vector map and later calculate shortest path connections based on
the accumulated costs. Applications are transport analysis, connectivity and
more. 

For details please read Blazek et al. 2002 (see below).
