<h2>GRASS 6 Programmer's Manual</h2>

GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is an open source,
Free Software Geographical Information System (GIS) with raster, topological
vector, image processing, and graphics production functionality that
operates on various platforms through a graphical user interface and shell
in X-Window. It is released under GNU General Public License (GPL).

This manual introduces the reader to the <i>Geographic Resources Analysis 
Support System</i> from the programming perspective. Design theory, system
support libraries, system maintenance, and system enhancement are all 
presented. Standard GRASS 4.x conventions are still used in much of the
code. This work is part of ongoing research being performed by the 
GRASS Development Team coordinated at <a href="http://mpa.itc.it/">ITC-irst</a>, Trento, Italy), 
an international team of programmers,
GRASS module authors are cited within their module's source code and the 
contributed manual pages.
