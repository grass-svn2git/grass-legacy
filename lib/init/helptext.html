<H1>GRASS Quickstart</H1>

<h2>Geographic Resources Analysis Support System</h2>

Commonly referred to as GRASS, this is a Geographic Information System
(GIS) used for geospatial data management and analysis, image
processing, graphics/maps production, spatial modeling, and
visualization. GRASS is currently used in academic and commercial
settings around the world, as well as by many governmental agencies
and environmental consulting companies.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
GRASS data are stored in a directory referred to as DATABASE
(also called ``GISDBASE'').  This directory has to be created
with <tt>mkdir</tt> or a filemanager, before starting to work
with GRASS.  Within this DATABASE, the projects are organized
by project areas stored in subdirectories called LOCATIONs.
<P>
A LOCATION is defined by its coordinate system, map projection and
geographical boundaries. The subdirectories and files defining a
LOCATION are created automatically when GRASS is started the first
time with a new LOCATION.
<P>
Each LOCATION can have several MAPSETs. One motivation to maintain
different mapsets is to store maps related to project issues or
subregions. Another motivation is to support simultaneous access of
several users to the map layers stored within the same LOCATION,
i.e. teams working on the same project. For teams a centralized GRASS
DATABASE would be defined in a network file system (e.g.
NFS). Besides access to his/her own MAPSET, each user can also read
map layers in other users' MAPSETs, but s/he can modify or remove only
the map layers in his/her own MAPSET.
<P>
When creating a new LOCATION, GRASS automatically creates a special
MAPSET called PERMANENT where the core data for the project can be
stored. Data in the PERMANENT MAPSET can only be added, modified or
removed by the owner of the PERMANENT MAPSET; however, they can be
accessed, analyzed, and copied into their own MAPSET by the other
users. The PERMANENT MAPSET is useful for providing general spatial
data such as elevation model write-protected to other users who are
working in the same LOCATION. To import data into PERMANENT, just
start GRASS with the relevant LOCATION and the PERMANENT MAPSET.  This
mapset also contains the DEFAULTWIND file which holds the default
region boundary coordinate values. In all mapsets additionally a WIND
file is kept for storing the current boundary coordinate values and
the currently selected raster resolution.

<h2>Creating a GRASS database</h2>

To create the GRASS database:

<OL>
<LI> Find a place on your disk where you have write access and that
    has enough diskspace to hold your decompresses data.</LI>
<LI> Create a subdirectory that will hold the general GRASS database
    (e.g. <tt>mkdir /data/GRASSDATA</tt> or 
    <tt>mkdir /home/yourlogin/GRASSDATA</tt>).</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Sample data such as the Spearfish sample dataset</A> may be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://grass.itc.it/download/data.php">http://grass.itc.it/download/data.php</A>.
<P>

Click on the button "Create New Location" which will get to the above
text screen on which you can enter a non-existing location name and
continue with ``ESC''-``RETURN''.
<P>
Now, you need to attribute different parameters to the location, such
as the coordinate system you want to use, including the ellipsoid, the
coordinates of the boundaries of the project area and the default
resolution for raster data:

<UL>
<LI> Start out by chosing between, x,y, Latitude-Longitude, UTM or
   another coordinate system. This choice depends on your data and the
   use will make of it.</LI>
<LI> Now one line describing the project area, for example "Topo Map
   of the Alps".</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Now some more information about the projection follows. Note that the
prompts vary from projection to projection:

<UL>
<LI> (if you chose "D - Other Projection") "specify projection name": 
  "list" gives you the list of all available projections, examples are 
  "tmerc" for Transverse Mercator, "lcc" for Lambert Conformal Conic,
  "moll" for Mollweide, etc.
<LI> specify ellipsoid name}: again use "list" to get a list of available 
  ellipsoids, examples are "sphere", "clark80", "wgs84", etc.
<LI> if you want, you can specify a datum, again use "list" for available
  options
<LI> Enter Central Parallel: 0 if you want the Equator as the
  central parallel
<LI> Enter Central Meridian: 0 if you want the Greenwich meridian as
  central meridian
<LI> Enter Scale Factor at the Central Meridian}
<LI> Enter plural form of units: for example, meters
</UL>

<P>
Next step is the description of the boundary coordinates of the project
area and the definition of the default raster resolution:
<P>
The default raster resolution (GRID RESOLUTION) has to be chosen
according to the needs. Generally, it is advisable to work in steps of
0.25 (0.25, 0.5, 1.75, 2.00, 12.25 etc.). This resolution does not
concern vector and site data since these are stored with their exact
coordinate values. Note that every raster map may have its own
resolution. You can leave this screen with ``ESC''-``RETURN'' and then
accept the list of parameters that appears, if everything is correct.
<P>
You will get back to the startup screen again to enter the mapset's
name (if not already entered). Another ``ESC''-``RETURN'' will finally
let you leave this screen. This mapset is created within the new
location by answering ``yes'' to the next question. The mapset will
use the parameters of the location (such as the region and resolution
definitions) as its default parameters.
<P>
Now the project area, i.e. the location including a mapset has been
created. You have "arrived" in the GRASS system and can start working
within this new location.
