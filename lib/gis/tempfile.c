/*!
 * \brief returns a temporary file name
 *
 * This routine
 * returns a pointer to a string containing a unique file name that can be used
 * as a temporary file within the module. Successive calls to G_tempfile() will
 * generate new names.
 * Only the file name is generated. The file itself is not created. To create the
 * file, the module must use standard UNIX functions which create and open files,
 * e.g., creat() or fopen().
 * The programmer should take reasonable care to remove (unlink) the file before
 * the module exits. However, GRASS database management will eventually remove
 * all temporary files created by G_tempfile() that have been left behind by
 * the modules which created them.
 *
 *  \return char:  pointer to a character string containing the name.
 *   the name is copied to allocated memory and may be
 *   released by the unix free () routine.
