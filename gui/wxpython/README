It was originally done by Jan-Oliver Wagner
as part of milestone three in the ossim-grass bridge project.

grass-interface.dtd
        The document type definition for
        xml-based GRASS user interface descriptions.

USAGE

 The XML stream is read from stdin, thus you
 may call it for instance this way:

 r.basins.fill --interface-description | python grassgui.py
  or
 r.basins.fill --interface-description | ./grassgui.py

 Or you set an alias or wrap the call up in a nice
 shell script, GUI environment ... please contribute your idea.
