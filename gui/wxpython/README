==============================

AUTHORS: Jachym, Michael
LAST CHANGE: 2007-3-25

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
 Python >=2.4 and wxPython 2.8.1.1

 Get wxPython 2.8.x packages from:
 * Debian: http://www.bitpim.org/developer.html -> "Install wxPython"
 * Fedora: 
 * Mandriva 2007: http://mpa.itc.it/markus/wxpython_rpms/
 * MS-Windows:
 * SuSe: 
 * Ubuntu: deb http://wxpython.wxcommunity.com/apt/ubuntu/dapper /
           deb http://wxpython.wxcommunity.com/apt/ubuntu/feisty /
---------------------------------------------------------------------

How to start:

Before you start
----------------
Download fresh source from subversion:
$~ svn co https://grasssvn.itc.it/svn/grassaddons/trunk/grassaddons/gui grassaddons/gui

Or update your local repository

$~ svn up grassaddons/gui

Change to GUI devel directory:

$~ cd grassaddons/gui

1 - INSTALLATION

Put everthing from gui into a new directory $GISBASE/etc/wx.

Move the script "wxgrass" into $GISBASE/scripts


2 - STARTUP WITH GRASS INITIALIZATION

If you want to start the wxgrass GUI automatically when you start GRASS, replace your $GRASS/etc/init.sh with the one that accompanies wxgrass. Rename your original init.sh to avoid overwriting it.

Edit your .grassrc6 file to replace...

GRASS_GUI: tcktk (or whatever you have here)

...with...

GRASS_GUI: wx

***NOTE***
You may need to edit init.sh to match your settings for LD_DISPLAY


3 - STARTUP FROM GRASS TERMINAL

Do not use the wxgrass init.sh. Simply type wxgrass& from the GRASS terminal to start the GUI using the wxgrass script.


4 - CLI MapDisplay scripts
------------------
This is going to be replacement for command line tools like d.rast and d.vect

Now add directory "scripts" in gui directory to your $PATH. This small
programms should later go to GRASS Scripts directory or became Python
scripts or C programs. Now they are small bash wrappers, which can be
easily and fast costumized.

$~ export PATH=scripts/:$PATH

Lounch GRASS, if you didn't it yet

$~ grass63 ~/grassdata/spearfish60/user1

Use command p.mon (shell script in gui/scripts direcotory) to start map
display:

GRASS> p.mon anything

After a while, new window should appear.  If this is your case, add some
raster layer to the map display:

GRASS> p.rast aspect

What about a bit transparency?

GRASS> p.rast elevation.dem opacity=0.5

And try the vector layer too

GRASS> p.vect roads

NOTE: only map name is currently supported. No other option will influence
      the map apperience


You should be abple to zoom && pan through the map, ones the layers are
displayed. You should be also able to store the display content as well as
clear the display and start from scratch.
