GRASS graphical user interface
==============================

AUTHORS: Jachym, Michael
LAST CHANGE: 2007-3-19

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
 Python >=2.3 and wxPython 2.8.1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

How to start:

Before you start
----------------
Download fresh source from subversion:
$~ svn co https://grasssvn.itc.it/svn/grassaddons/trunk/grassaddons/gui grassaddons/gui

Or update your local repository

$~ svn up grassaddons/gui

Change to GUI devel directory:

$~ cd grassaddons/gui

1 - CLI MapDisplay
------------------
This is going to be replacement for command line tools like d.rast and d.vect 

Now add directory "scripts" in gui directory to your $PATH. This small
programms should later go to GRASS Scripts directory or became Python
scripts or C programs. Now they are small bash wrappers, which can be
easily and fast costumized.

$~ export PATH=scripts/:$PATH

Lounch GRASS, if you didn't it yet

$~ grass63 ~/grassdata/spearfish60/user1

Use command p.mon (shell script in gui/scripts direcotory) to start map
display:

GRASS> p.mon anything

After a while, new window should appear.  If this is your case, add some
raster layer to the map display:

GRASS> p.rast aspect

What about a bit transparency?

GRASS> p.rast elevation.dem opacity=0.5

And try the vector layer too

GRASS> p.vect roads

NOTE: only map name is currently supported. No other option will influence
      the map apperience


You should be abple to zoom && pan through the map, ones the layers are
displayed. You should be also able to store the display content as well as
clear the display and start from scratch.

2 - GIS Manager
---------------
This is a bit tricky

3 - Start-up screen with Location wizard
----------------------------------------
This is even more complicated :-)
