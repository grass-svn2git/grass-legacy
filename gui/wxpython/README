 E.g. On Debian GNU/Linux install these packages:
 apt-get install libwxbase2.8-0 libwxbase2.8-dbg libwxbase2.8-dev \
 	 libwxgtk2.8-0 libwxgtk2.8-dbg libwxgtk2.8-dev \
	 python-wxgtk2.8 wx2.8-doc wx2.8-examples \
	 wx2.8-headers wx2.8-i18n

1 - INSTALLATION

Go to directory:

$ cd gui/wxpython

1) Copy everything from gui directory into a new directory $GISBASE/etc/wx.
     Or easier, create symlink (in running GRASS session):
	 ln -s `pwd` $GISBASE/etc/wx

2) Copy the script "wxgrass" into $GISBASE/scripts.
     Or easier, create symlink (in running GRASS session):
         ln -s `pwd`/wxgrass $GISBASE/scripts

2 - STARTUP WITH GRASS INITIALIZATION

If you want to run wxPython GUI automatically when you start
GRASS, edit your .grassrc6 file to replace...

GRASS_GUI: tcktk (or whatever you have here)

with

GRASS_GUI: wx

or easier start new GRASS session with -wx switch.

$ grass -wx

3 - STARTUP FROM GRASS TERMINAL

Simply type

$ wxgrass

from the GRASS terminal.

You can also specify workspace file to load on startup.

$ wxgrass myworkspace.grc

4 - CLI Display scripts

Note: This section is out-dated.

This is going to be replacement for command line tools like d.rast and
d.vect.

Now add directory "scripts" in gui directory to your $PATH. These
little programs should later go to GRASS Scripts directory or became
Python scripts or C programs. Now they are only small BASH wrappers
which can be easily and fast customized.

$~ export PATH=scripts/:$PATH

Start GRASS:

$~ grass63 ~/grassdata/spearfish60/user1

Use command p.mon (shell script in gui/scripts directory) to start map
display:

GRASS> p.mon anything

After a while, new window should appear.  If this is your case, add some
raster layer to the map display:

GRASS> p.rast aspect

What about a bit transparency?

GRASS> p.rast elevation.dem opacity=0.5

And try the vector layer too

GRASS> p.vect roads

NOTE: only map name is currently supported. No other option will influence
      the map layout

Alternatively you can use more universal p.cmd:

GRASS> p.cmd "d.rast map=elevation.dem@PERMANENT catlist=1300-1400 -i"

You should be able to zoom && pan through the map, once the layers are
displayed. You should be also able to store the display content as well as
clear the display and start from scratch.

5 - DEBUGGING

To enable GUI debugging messages on given level set GRASS_DEBUG_WX
environment variables, e.g.

$ export GRASS_WX_DEBUG=3

6 - ICON THEMES

Currently only two icon themes are available:
    * default (based on TCL/TK GUI prototype)
     * Silk

To enable 'Silk' icon theme set GRASS variable:

$ g.gisenv set=GRASS_ICONPATH=$GISBASE/etc/wx/icons/silk

To re-enable default icons (TCL/TK theme)

$ g.gisenv set=GRASS_ICONPATH=

7 - DIGITIZATION TOOL

To enable digitization tool you need to compile display driver located
in directory 'display_driver'. Note that you need to compile GRASS
with C++ support (--with-cxx).

First, create symlink, e.g.

$ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/_gdi_.so $GISBASE/lib/libgdi.so

Then you can compile the driver

$ cd $GISBASE/etc/wx/display_driver
$ make
