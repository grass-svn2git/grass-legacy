<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>Vector digitizing tool</b> is
a <em><a href="wxGUI.html">wxGUI</a></em> component intended for
interactive editing vector maps
(see <em><a href="v.edit.html">v.edit</a></em> for non-interactive
vector editing GRASS capabilities).

<p>
Currently, only 2D vector features (points, lines, centroids and
boundaries) can be edited.

Vector features can be selected using mouse or by query (e.g. minimal
vector line length). Vector features can be selected by bounding box
or simply by mouse click (based on 'Settings->General->Select
threshold' value).

<p>
Vector digitizer can be activated from Main toolbar in Map Display by
selecting "Digitize" from "Tools" combobox. Vector map to be edited
can be afterwards selected from digitizer toolbar ("Select vector map"
combobox, note that only vector maps from the current layer tree in Layer
Manager are available).

Vector digitizer can be alternatively also activated from contextual
menu in Layer Manager by selecting "Start editing" on selected vector
map in the layer tree.

<p>
New vector map can be easily created from digitizer toolbar by
selecting "New vector map" in "Select vector map" combobox. A new
vector map is created, added to the current layer tree in Layer
Manager and opened for editing. "Select vector map" combobox in
digitizer toolbar also allows switching easily between vector maps to be
edited.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<i>Dead (deleted)</i> are internally only marked in the geometry file
as 'dead' but it remains there and occupies space. Any vector module
used afterwards on this vector map which really reads and writes
vector geometry (so not <em><a href="g.copy.html">g.copy</a></em>)
will writes only features which are 'alive'.

<p>
<i>Added or modified</i> vector features are <i>snapped</i> to
existing vector features ('Settings->General->Snapping', nodes or vertices)
based on 'Settings->General->Snapping threshold' value. To
disable snapping set the snapping threshold to '0'.

<p>
If the digitizer crashes for some reason you can repair the vector map
which was left open with the <em>v.build</em> module.

    by query.</dd>

      <li>Copy features from (background) map<br> Make identical copy of

      <li>Merge selected lines/boundaries<br> Merge (at least two)

	merged vector lines can be changed. If the second line from
	two selected lines is in opposite direction to the first, it
	will be flipped. See also

	vector features in given threshold. See also
	module <em><a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a></em>. Note that

      <li>Connect two selected lines/boundaries<br> Connect selected
	lines or boundaries, the first given line is connected to the

	are connected only if distance between them is not greater
