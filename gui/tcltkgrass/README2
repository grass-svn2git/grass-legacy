This is a port of the GRASS 5.3 TclTk menu GUI to GRASS 5.7

It includes nearly all functional commands in the March 20 2004 build of
GRASS 5.7 and only the commands available for GRASS 5.7 (omitted are a few
that aren't appropriate for the menus, such as commands designed for
scripting or testing commands).
