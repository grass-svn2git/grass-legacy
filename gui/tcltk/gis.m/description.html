<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <b>GRASS GIS Manager</b>
provides an interactive graphical interface to GRASS commands. By
default, it is started automatically with each GRASS session. The GIS
Manager can be quit by selecting the <em>'File-&gt;Exit</em><em>'</em>
menu item. The GIS Manager can be restarted from the GRASS command line
shell by typing "<i>gis.m &amp;</i>".<br>

<br>
The GIS Manager includes a set of pull-down menus for many GIS
functions (analysis, file I/O, GIS configuration and management), two
rows of buttons that control display functions, an upper window in
which layers to display are organized, a row of display monitor control
buttons along the left side of the layer tree window, and a lower
window which contains options panels for layers in the layer tree. <br>
<br>
The top row of buttons control a series of display functions:
displaying or redisplaying all map layers in the default monitor
window, zooming and panning, simple queries, starting NVIZ
(n-dimensional visualization) or XGANIM (display animator) display
interfaces, and saving or opening group display file. The second row of
buttons add, copy, or remove map layers to be displayed, and activate
the raster and vector digitizing interfaces. <em><b>Mouse-over help</b></em>
is available for all buttons.<br>
<br>
Map layers are organized as a layer tree, in the window below the
buttons. Layers can include raster and vector maps, text, map
enhancements (scale and north arrow, grids, and frames), and commands
(where any GRASS command be written). Layers are displayed in the order
added to the layer tree: the first added (i.e., at the top of the tree)
is displayed first, followed by the next added, etc. This means that
the uppermost layer is 'on the bottom' and the lowermost is 'on top' if
layers are thought of as a series of stacked overlays. Any layer can be
renamed by double clicking on its name and typing a new name.<br>
<br>
The check box to the left of each layer makes it active for display.
Active layers are only displayed/redisplayed when the display button is
pressed. Layers can be organized into groups; entire groups can be
activated or deactivated for display. Groups can be saved to a file and
opened in subsequent sessions, restoring all layers and their display
options.<br>
<br>
When a layer is selected with the mouse, its options are shown in the
panel below the layer tree window. Help for each layer type can be
accessed by pressing the GRASS button in the option panel.<br>
