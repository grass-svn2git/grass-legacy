HOWTO translate GRASS messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

$Id$

Updating the message catalogs currently only works on 
unix-like systems and requires xgettext.

REQUIRED SOURCE CODE CHANGES

Generally, to support i18N multiple languages,
message strings in GRASS must be modified from

 fprintf ( ..., "...");
to
 fprintf ( ..., _("..."));

These strings will be then extracted automatically into the
POT file. 
Also needed:
 #include "glocale.h"
This line has to be added to each file with messages.

------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL PROCEDURE

 POT files ----> PO files      ----> MO files
 (original       (translated        (final message file
  messages)       messages)          used by binaries)

Local Makefile usage:
   make pot        create grass.pot (containing original messages)
   make update-po  merge new messages into existing *.po files
   make mo         create the mo files


A convenient software package to translate messages is 'kbabel'.
It permits to enhance it's message database by loading existing
.po files to semi-automate the translation.

GRASS must be configured with '--with-nls' and recompiled.

There is a file for all library messages and another for all
module messages (this might be split in future).

------------------------------------------------------
DETAILED PROCEDURE:

1. Define/check language settings

   echo $LANG
   echo $LANGUAGE

   Maybe you have to change it (example for Japanese):
   - for bash shell:
       export LANG=ja_JP
       export $LANGUAGE=ja_JP
   - for (t)csh shell:
       setenv LANG ja_JP
       setenv LANGUAGE ja_JP

2. CREATE POT FILES
   run
    make pot
    
   This will create
    ./templates/grasslibs.pot
    ./templates/grassmods.pot
       
    
3. CREATE LANGUAGE FILES

   Two cases have to be distinguished:
    a) Messages have not yet been translated to your language.
    b) Some messages have already been translated to your language,
       so you want to merge your efforts into the existing translation.
       
  3.a) First CASE: Messages have not yet been translated to your language.
       No .po file is present for your language in the ./po/ directory.
      
       Run:
        make pot
        make update-po
 
       Rename the generated file in the ./po/ directory:
   
       For example (German):
        mv ./po/grasslibs.pot ./po/grasslibs_de.po
        mv ./po/grassmods.pot ./po/grassmods_de.po


  3.b) Second CASE: Some messages have already been translated to 
       your language (files present in ./po/ directory), and
       you want to continue with translating new and still
       untranslated messages.

       First we have to merge new messages into existing .po files 
       (which contain already translated messages) as new messages
       might have been added into the GRASS system. 
       To do so, run:
    
       make pot
       make update-po
    
       This will update all existing files in the .po directory.
    


4. TRANSLATE MESSAGES
   Run 'kbabel' or equivalent program
    kbabel ./po/grasslibs_<LANGUAGE>.po
    kbabel ./po/grassmods_<LANGUAGE>.po

   For example (German):
    kbabel ./po/grasslibs_de.po
    kbabel ./po/grassmods_de.po

   KBABEL: You may load .po files from other projects [see footnote 1]
   
   Pay attention to keep '%s', '\n' and other stuff also 
   in the translated messages!
   
   After finishing the translation, save the files.


     
5. CREATE MO FILES

   run
    make mo

   READY.


6. Now recompile, install and run GRASS.
   It should work :-)

7. Send the updated .po files to a GRASS Development Team member.
   If you already updated .c files with _(...) macro as explained
   above, please send diffs against CVS:
   
   cvs diff -u file.c > file.diff
   
   In this case send both the C diff files and the .po files.

NOTES

[1] To load existing .po files (eg from older GRASS versions) into
    Kbabel, use
    KBABEL -> SETTINGS -> CONFIGURE DIRECTORY -> PO AUXILIARY

[2] To use QGIS' TS files, you have to convert them to PO format.
    TS files -> PO files converter:
    To translate the .ts files e.g. from QGIS to .po files, 
    use
      http://oss.erdfunkstelle.de/ts2msg/index.shtml

    cd qgis/i18n
    ts2msg utf8 qgis_de.ts
    -> qgis_de.po
