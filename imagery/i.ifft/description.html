<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>i.ifft</EM> is an image processing program based on the algorithm given
by Frigo et al. (1998), that converts real and imaginary frequency space
images (produced by
<EM><A HREF="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></EM>) into a normal image.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The current mask is respected when reading the real and
imaginary component files;  thus, 


<EM><A HREF="r.mask.html">r.mask</A></EM> become a primary program for
selecting the portion of the frequency space data to be included in the
inverse transform.  The GRASS program <EM>r.digit</EM> can be used to create
masks while viewing the real or imaginary component image. Alternatively
<em>r.circle</em> can be used to generate high-, low- and donut filters
specifying the DC point as circle/ring center.
When <EM>i.ifft</EM> is executed, it (automatically) uses the same GRASS
region definition setting that was used during the original transformation
done with <EM><A HREF="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></EM>.


<P>

The real and imaginary components are read from arrays of
doubles in the <EM>cell_misc</EM> directory (produced by
the forward transform program,

<EM><A HREF="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></EM>),

and the reconstructed image will preserve the cell value
scaling of the original image processed by

<EM><A HREF="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></EM>.  No color
table is assigned to the output map;  one should be created
before viewing the <EM>output_image</EM>.
