<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>photo.init</EM>
creates or modifies entries in a camera initial 
exposure station file for imagery group referenced by a sub-block.  
These entries include:
the (XC,YC,ZC) UTM approximate coordinates of the camera exposure station;
initial roll, pitch, and yaw angles (in degrees) of the cameras attitude; 
and the <EM>a priori</EM> standard deviations for these parameters.
During the imagery program, hoto.rectify,
the initial camera exposure station file 
is used for computation of the ortho-rectification parameters.  
If no initial camera
exposure station file exist, the default values are computed from the control 
points file created in <EM><A HREF="photo.2target.html">photo.2target</A></EM>.

The INITIAL values for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in UTM coordinates, and
represent an approximation for the location of the camera at the time of 
exposure.


<P>

The INITIAL values for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed in degrees, and
represent an approximation for the cameras attitude  at the time of 
exposure. 


<P>

The standard deviations for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in meters, and
are used as <EM>a priori</EM> values for the standard deviations used in 
computation of the ortho rectification parameters.


<P>

The standard deviations for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed in degrees, and
are used as <EM>a priori</EM> values for the standard deviations used in 
computation of the ortho rectification parameters.
