- menu 6: photo.init
          it's unclear at time if these values are used in case the user
          selects 0
               Use these values at run time? (1=yes, 0=no)            0_
           
           -> should be explained in manual
  
- menu 7: photo.2target
          after selecting (click) the second control point in the right
          window, this GCP isn't shown, should be drawn in orange color
          before asking for confirmation.

- menu 8: photo.rectify
          Option 2: seems that the calculation of the minimal region is
                    to small - sometimes part of the image borders is cut
                    off
