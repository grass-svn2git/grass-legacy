<h2>
1. Get the Cygwin tools</h2>
The Cygwin tools are required to run UNIX
compliant applications on Windows.
<br>Get the latest version from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>.
<p>Download the file <tt>setup.exe</tt>
to a local disk, run it and follow the instructions.
<p>When installing the Cygwin tools, please
select all packages, or at least:
<ul>

<li> ash, bash, bzip2, clear, cygwin, file, fileutils, findutils,
gawk, gettext, grep, groff, gzip, inetutils, jpeg, less, libpng,
login, man, ncurses, opengl, perl, readline, regex, sed,
sh-utils/shellutils, sunrpc, tar, tcsh, termcap, texinfo, textutils,
tiff, time, unzip, w32api, zip, zlib</li>

<li>
Remark: This list contains only the packages
that are strictly required for running GRASS. For production use of the
cygwin environment you will probably install other packages in addition. </li>
</ul>
Please select for the install directory a
local drive on your computer with enough space for the entire cygwin distribution
(150 MB without X11R6.4), the X Window System (additional 65 MB) and the
GRASS binaries (programs, about 150 MB). If you want to do real work, you
need at least another 500 MB for GRASS data storage.
<p>Additionally you will need the precompiled
X Window (XFree86, X11R6.4) System. See next paragraph.
<p>
<b>NOTE: When selecting the root install directory, make sure that
the "Default Text File Type" is set to Unix.</b>

<h2>
2. Install the X11 libraries and the X Server</h2>
<b>NOTE: not needed for the winGRASS with
generic display driver</b>
<p>

If you want to use the GRASS monitors (graphical output), you need the X
Server and the X11 libraries. Get them by selecting the XFree86 options in
the Cygwin setup program checklist. <BR>
Download at least the following XFree packages: base, bin, lib, etc, doc,
fnts, f100, prog and xserv. Please refer to the XFree install guide for
further details.

<P>
<i>Alternative to XFree/Cygwin:</i><br>
There are a lot of different free and commercial servers. 
If you don't want to use the XFree Server, you can download the StarNet X Server from
<a href="http://www.starnet.com/en/products/">http://www.starnet.com/en/products/</a>. This is a demo version that will time out
after 2 hours. You can restart it again after it times out. 
Currently only the XFree86 Server and the StarNet X Server have been tested with the GRASS distribution. 
The Microimages X Server will not work reliable with the X11R6.4 libraries
GRASS is linked with. 

<ul>

Other, commercial servers are available:</li>

<li>

</ul>


<h2>
3. Get the latest binary distribution for GRASS</h2>

You can download either 
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://grass.itc.it/grass5/binary/windows_cygnus/wingrass_generic/">winGRASS with generic display
driver</a> including the install script &nbsp;<i>or</i>
<li><a href="http://grass.itc.it/grass5/binary/windows_cygnus/wingrass_xserver/">winGRASS with X11 display display
driver</a> (requires X Server, see above) including the install script.
</ul>

<h2>
4. Only, when using winGRASS with X11 display: Get the tcl/tk 8.x libraries
</h2>

<b>NOTE: you need to ensure that the "official" Cygwin Tcl/Tk package
   *is not* installed.</b> (see Cygwin setup for this issue).
<P>
The only GRASS features which require an X Server are tcltkgrass and NVIZ.
Hopefully, it will be possible to use tcltkgrass on Cygwin without X
in the near future, although NVIZ will require X for the foreseeable
future.

<p>
Download the precompiled X tcl/tk 8.x libraries and executables from
<br><a
href="http://grass.itc.it/grass5/binary/windows_cygnus/wingrass_xserver/">http://grass.itc.it/grass5/binary/windows_cygnus/wingrass_xserver/</a>.

<p>
Go to the root directory (<tt>cd /</tt>) and unpack this file:

<pre>
cd /
tar xzf /where/ever/you/saved/this/xtcltk-*.tar.gz
</pre>

<h2>
5. And now FINALLY to the GRASS installation</h2>

Log into the cygwin shell. Please check the
required disk space and permissions first. The default installation path
is <tt>/usr/local/grass5</tt>. Next:
<pre><tt>&nbsp; cd /wherever/you/saved/package</tt></pre>
<pre><tt>&nbsp; ./grass5install.sh grass5.0.2_i686-pc-cygwin_bin.tar.gz</tt></pre>

This will install the GRASS package under <tt>/usr/local/grass5</tt> and
store the start files under <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. Please note that the
paths are all relative to the cygwin root (usually <tt>C:\CYGWIN</tt> or
<tt>C:\PROGRAM FILES\CYGWIN</tt> or similar). Do not install the file from
the root directory of cygwin (<tt>C:\CYGWIN</tt> from Windows or <tt>/</tt>
from within cygwin), due to some bug of cygwin this will result in an error.

<p>Next you should install some data to test
GRASS. You can get the <tt>global_grass5data.tar.gz</tt> sample data set from <a href="http://grass.itc.it/data.html">http://grass.itc.it/data.html</a>.
Unpack the data with:
<pre><tt>tar xzf global_grass5data.tar.gz</tt></pre>
in an empty directory, e. g.
<tt>/home/andreas/data</tt>.
Again remember to do this from within the cygwin shell.

<h2>
6. <a NAME="Start GRASS"></a>Starting GRASS 5</h2>

You can log into a GRASS session on the commandline
by issuing '<tt>grass5</tt>' in the cygwin shell. Follow the
on-screen description and enter in the directories for your sample data.
<P>

Depending on the winGRASS version you use (generic winGRASS or winGRASS
with X Server support), you continue like this:

<h3>6.1 winGRASS with generic display driver</h3>

To open a GRASS monitor, enter:
<pre>
d.mon x0
d.mon sel=x0
</pre>

Then continue as usual. All GRASS modules <b>except</b> 'tcltkgrass' and 'nviz'
are supported.

<h3>6.2 winGRASS with X Server support under XFree86</h3>

This version supports all GRASS modules including 'tcltkgrass' and 'nviz'.
There are two options to use the XFree86 Server: With on desktop (stable)
or in multiwindow mode (not yet stable).
<P>

<b>6.2.1 XFree86 desktop mode</b><P>

In cygwin, launch the XFree86 server at Cygwin Bash prompt with:

<pre>
startxwin.bat
</pre>

Then start GRASS in a terminal within the X desctop.

<P>
<b>6.2.2 XFree86 multiwindow mode</b><P>

In cygwin, launch the XFree86 server at Cygwin Bash prompt with:

<pre>
export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0
XWin -multiwindow  -clipboard &
</pre>
Now the X Server is listening and will open X related windows in 
individual windows. Then start GRASS as usual:

<pre>
grass5
d.mon x0
d.mon sel=x0

tcltkgrass &
nviz elevation.dem vect=roads &
</pre>

This runs GRASS similar to a common MS-Windows application.
<P>
Please also read the 
<a href=http://cygwin.com/xfree/docs/ug/cygwin-xfree-ug.html>Cygwin/XFree86
User's Guide</a>.


<h3>6.3 winGRASS with X Server support and Star Net XWin-32</h3>

<p>On the GRASS web site you can find a 
<a href=http://grass.itc.it/grass5/binary/windows_cygnus/wingrass_xserver/old/><tt>StartGrass.bat</tt></a>
script to put in your home directory. Please edit this file to adapt to your
local paths. This sets the PATH and all needed environment variables and 
spawns an xterm window. From within that window run <tt>'grass5'</tt>.


<p>Please report any problems, errors and
solutions to the GRASS developers mailing list at 
<a href="http://grass.itc.it/grassdevel.html#list">http://grass.itc.it/grassdevel.html#list</a>
or the winGRASS mailing list at 
<a href="http://grass.itc.it/wingrass.html">http://grass.itc.it/wingrass.html</a>.
