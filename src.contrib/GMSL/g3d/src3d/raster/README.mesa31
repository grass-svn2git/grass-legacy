----------------------------------------------------------
Installing Mesa 3.1 libraries (do this as root!) on linux:

I did not test this on other unix platforms, but the mesa
documentation says that autoconf works on all unix platforms
with X11. 

You must have installed the X11-development libraries, see
the documentation of your distribution which packets you need.

1. Get the sources for the libraries from:
   http://www.mesa3d.org/
   http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/download.html
   (please use a mirror near you!)

   You need the file:   Mesalib-3.x.tar.gz (1.6 MB)
   (and optional:       MesaDemos-3.x.tar.gz (1.1 MB) )
	where x is currently sub-version 2   

2. unpack the sources in a directory of your choice (e. g. /tmp):

     tar xzf Mesalib-*.tar.gz
     (tar xzf Mesa-Demos-*.tar.gz)

3. cd to the new directory:
     cd Mesa*
   read the docs/README file (less docs/README)
   read the docs/INSTALL file (less docs/INSTALL)
   configure the libraries with:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
   compile and install the libraries with:
     make install 
   
   if you want to test the libraries:
     make check
   if you want to execute and install the demos:
     make exec

   In contradiction to the Mesa-docs you do not need to 
   install the include directory or the library files 
   manually. 

   You do not need to compile the SGI widgets if you only
   want to compile NVIZ2.2.

   If you want to compile r3.showdspf.openGL you must manually
   compile the SGI widgets from the directory widgets-sgi.
   The mesa widgets (widgets-mesa) use autoconf, but there was
   no shared library build when i compiled them, so i could not
   use them. If you re-try this, use --with-motif and --prefix=/usr
   for ./configure!

   See at the end of this document for a short, prelimnary 
   instruction for the SGI widgets. 

   Do _not_ install the mesa-libraries under /usr/local/lib
   (this is the default!), because on most systems /usr/local/lib
   is not included in the search path for shared libraries.
   If you must install the libraries in your home directory or another
   local path, you must 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/shared_libs'.
   Or add manually the path to the libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf, 
   but this requires root privileges, so you could easily install the shared 
   libraries in /usr/lib. Run ldconfig after any change of /etc/ld.so.conf,
   see man ldconfig for further details. 

4. compile NVIZ2.2, see the file README in
   grass5.0beta/src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2

5. If you need the SGI Widgets for r3.showdspf.openGL:
   cd to the widgets-sgi directory of the mesa distribution.
   The SGI Widgets do _not_ use the autoconf mechanism, so you 
   must manually invoke make and manually install the libraries.
   First: Edit the file Makefile.X11:
   uncomment '#SOURCES = GLwDrawA.c GLwMDrawA.c' and
   comment 'SOURCES = GLwDrawA.c'. 
   Next: do a 'make linux-elf' to build the shared libraries.
   You get an error because the lib-dir is wrong. Don't care.
   Now copy the libraries to /usr/lib (root priviledges needed):
   cp -dpa libGLw.so* /usr/lib   
   Now run /sbin/ldconfig and you are done!

Remarks von Dietrich Lange (derdietrich@yahoo.de) 05.04.2002 to this point:

Compiling of the SGI Widgets for r3.showdspf.openGL and the r3* commands.

i downloaded Mesa-3.5, and in the directory wiedgets-sgi i didn't find an configure file and 
none Makefile.X11.

Therefore i used the code in widgets-mesa:

./configure --with-motif --prefix=/usr
make

produces the libaries in ./src:

-rw-r--r--    1 dietrich users       25428 Apr  5 14:17 libMesaGLw.a
-rw-r--r--    1 dietrich users       27718 Apr  5 14:17 libMesaGLwM.a

i copied these files to /usr/lib:

cp -dpai libMesaGL* /usr/lib  
updated the linker:
/sbin/ldconfig

still the compiling process of 

gmake5 -i src.contrib/GMSL/g3d

didn't work, because there the linker couldnt find libaries. 

Afer some testing it worked with the following:

There i changed the file:

src.contrib/GMSL/g3d/src3d/raster/r3.showdspf.openGL/Gmakefile

as shown below, and not as described in [GRASSLIST:1489]:Re: r3.showdspf, 
because there they seem to work in ,my case with other libaries:

original: 

OGLLIB=  $(OPENGLULIB) -lGL $(OPENGLWM) -lXm -lX11 -lXt -lXext

after some experiments it worked in my case with following configuration: 

OGLLIB=  $(OPENGLULIB)  -lGL -lGLw -lMesaGLw -lMesaGLwM $(OPENGLWM) -lXm -lX11 -lXt -lXext

then i changed back to the main-directory of grass and did:

gmake5 -i src.contrib/GMSL/g3d
gmakelinks5 -i

and could use the r3* commands.
