<h3>NVIZ - Description</h3>

<em> nviz </em> is meant to be used as a tool for viewing data
surfaces in three dimensions using <strong>GRASS</strong> on
<em>Silicon Graphics IRIS</em> computers.  It evolved from
the earlier <strong>GRASS</strong> program
<em>SG3d</em>. Users familiar with <em>SG3d</em>
will find <em>nviz</em> similar but with a slightly different
interface and many added features. New features include the ability to
visualize multiple raster, vector, and site files at one time, and the
addition of volume data among others.  Hardware requirements are a
Z-buffer and 24 bit graphics OR a 24 bit graphic emulator, such as
that on the <em>IRIS Indigo</em>. 

<em>nviz</em> uses raster files as "elevation" and also as
attributes of the surfaces (such as color, transparency, etc.).  While
a true elevation data file used as elevation will produce the most
realistic surfaces, users are encouraged to be creative in selecting
other types of data to be represented by the vertical dimension.  Most
continuous (as opposed to discrete) data types will result in a
visualization that makes sense.  While developing the program, we used
chemical concentrations as the elevation file with good visual
results. 

Emphasis during development was on ease and speed of viewer
positioning and flexibility for using a wide range of data values and
sizes.  Since a wire grid can be drawn very quickly, such a grid is
used to provide real-time viewer positioning capabilities.  Similarly,
a lighting "model" provides real-time feedback as the user adjusts
lighting.  Grid and polygon resolution control allows the user to
further refine drawing speed and detail as needed.  Continuous scaling
of elevation values from 1.0ee-7 to 1.0ee+7 provides the ability to
use various data types for the vertical dimension.
