./:
The vis5d_config.c program creates the config.h file for use by libv5d.
The resulting config.h file is for use by original Vis5d code only.
This directory should NOT be added to any CFLAGS.  

./lib:
The lib directory has original source from Vis5d+ (version 1.2.1).
The Vis5d code in lib requires a "../config.h" file.
The lib directory may be added to CFLAGS when libv5d is used.
