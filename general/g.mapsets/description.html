<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
For basic information about Grass <em>mapset</em>, <em>location</em>
and <em>data base</em> refer to <a HREF="helptext.html">GRASS Quickstart</a>.
<p>
A <em>mapset</em> holds a distinct set of data layers,
each relevant to the same (or a subset of the same) geographic region,
and each drawn in the same map coordinate system.
At the outset of every GRASS session, the user identifies a
GRASS data base, location, and mapset that are to be the
user's <em>current data base</em>, <em>current location</em>,
and <em>current mapset</em> for the duration of the session;
any maps created by the user during the session
will be stored under the <em>current mapset</em> (<kbd>$MAPSET</kbd>)
set at the session's outset.



<p>

The user can add, modify, and delete data layers that exist
under his <em>current mapset</em>.  Although the user can
also <em>access</em> (i.e., use) data that are stored under
<em>other</em> mapsets in the same GRASS location, the user
can only make permanent changes (create or modify data)
located in the <em>current mapset</em>.  The user's
<em>mapset search path</em> lists the order in which other
mapsets in the same GRASS location can be searched and
their data accessed by the user.  The user can modify the
listing and order in which these mapsets are accessed by
modifying the mapset search path; this can be done using
the <em>g.mapsets</em> command.  This program allows the
user to use other's relevant map data without altering the
original data layer, and without taking up disk space with
a copy of the original map.


<p>

<em>g.mapsets</em> shows the user available mapsets under
the current GRASS location, lists mapsets to which the user
currently has access, and lists the order in which
accessible mapsets will be accessed by GRASS programs
searching for data files.  The user is then given the
opportunity to add or delete mapset names from his search
path, or modify the order in which mapsets will be
accessed.

<p>

When the user specifies the name of a data base element file
(e.g., a particular vector file, raster file, 
<a HREF="i.group.html">imagery</a> group file, etc.)
to a GRASS program, the program searches for the named file
under each of the mapsets listed in the user's mapset search path
in the order listed there until the program finds a file
of the given name.  (Users can also specify a file by
its mapset, to make explicit the mapset from which the file is to be
drawn;  e.g., the command:


<div class="code"><pre>
<b><a HREF="g.copy.html">g.copy</a> rast=</b><em>'soils.file@PERMANENT',my.soils</em>
</pre></div>


ensures that a new file named <em>my.soils</em> is to be a copy of
the file <em>soils.file</em> from the mapset PERMANENT.)

<p>

It is common for a user to have the special mapset
<b>PERMANENT</b> included in his mapset search path, as
this mapset typically contains finished base maps relevant
to many applications.  Often, other mapsets which contain
sets of interpreted map layers will be likewise included in
the user's mapset search path.  Suppose, for example, that
the mapset <em>Soil_Maps</em> contains interpreted soils
map layers to which the user wants access.  The mapset

<em>Soil_Maps</em> should then be included in the user's
<em>search path</em> variable.

<p>

The <em>mapset search path</em> is saved as part of the
current mapset.  When the user works with that mapset in
subsequent GRASS sessions, the previously saved mapset
search path will be used (and will continue to be used
until it is modified by the user with <em>g.mapsets</em>).

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<h3>Flags:</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>-l</b> 
<dd>List all available mapsets under the user's current location.
<dt><b>-p</b> 
<dd>Print the user's current mapset search path to standard output.
</dl>

<h3>Parameters:</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>mapset=</b><em>name</em>[,<em>name</em>,...]

<dd>Name(s) of existing GRASS mapset(s) under the current location.
<dt><b>addmapset=</b><em>name</em>[,<em>name</em>,...]
<dd>Name(s) of existing mapset(s) to add to search list
</dl>
-->

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>g.mapsets</em> sets the current <em>mapset search
path</em> to the <em>mapsets</em> named on the command
line.  If <b>g.mapsets</b> is typed but no <em>mapset</em>

names are specified by the user on the command line, the
program will print the user's current mapset search path,
list available mapsets, and prompt the user for a new
mapset search path listing.

<p>

The <em>addmapset</em> parameter allows for extending an existing
<em>mapset search path</em>.

<p>

Users can restrict others' access to their mapset files
through use of the GRASS program

<em><a HREF="g.access.html">g.access</a></em>.  

Mapsets to which access is restricted can still be listed
in another's mapset search path; however, access to these
mapsets will remain restricted.
