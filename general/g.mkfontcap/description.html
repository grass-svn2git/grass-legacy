<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>
<EM>g.mkfontcap</EM> is a utilty to generate a GRASS font configuration file
("fontcap") containing details of the fonts available on the current system.
If <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">Freetype</a> is not installed,
the font list will be limited to the set of Hershey stroke fonts supplied
with GRASS. With Freetype enabled however, the module will recursively scan 
all files within a predefined hierarchy to find Freetype-compatible scalable
fonts. The list of directories scanned is currently:
<div class="code"><pre>
    /usr/lib/X11/fonts
    /usr/share/X11/fonts
    /usr/share/fonts
    ${HOME}/Library/Fonts
    /Library/Fonts
    /System/Library/Fonts
    ${WINDIR}/Fonts
</pre></div>
These correspond to directories where fonts can be found on some common
operating systems. Extra directories to search can easily by added using the
<em>extradirs</em> parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list.</p>

<p>The module will normally write to the standard fontcap file location,
<tt>$GISBASE/etc/fontcap</tt>. If the environment variable
<strong>GRASS_FONT_CAP</strong> is set, the output will instead be written 
to the file specifed by that variable.</p>

<p>The output list of fonts is sorted first by type (Stoke fonts first,
followed by Freetype) and within each type by the full name of the font. The
full name normally consists of the font face famlily name followed by the
font style (i.e. Regular, Italic etc.).</p>
