<h2>NAME</h2>
<em><b>g.access</b></em>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program allows the user to control access to the
current mapset.  Normally, any user can read data from any
GRASS mapset. But sometimes it is desirable to prohibit
access to certain sensitive data. The <EM>g.access</EM>
command allows a user to restrict read and execute access
to the current mapset (see UNIX <EM>chmod</EM> command).
<EM>g.access</EM> will not modify write access to the
current mapset.

<P>

The user may, for example, allow only users in the same
UNIX group to read data files in the mapset, or restrict
the mapset to personal use only.

<P>
After typing 
<DL>
<DD>
<B>g.access</B> 
</DL>
the user will be presented with a screen page which reflects the current 
mapset permissions. The user can then change them. 
The screen page looks like:

| This program allows you to control access to your        |

|                                                          |
| Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for       |
| everyone in your group.                                  |
|                                                          |
| Mark an 'x' to allow access;  erase the field to         |

</PRE>

If you remove the x (using the space bar), access will be denied to that 
class of user (group or other). 
If you type an x, access will be granted to that class of user. 

<H2>NOTES</H2>

There is no non-interactive version of <EM>g.access</B>.</EM> 

<P> Under GRASS, access to the mapset PERMANENT must be open to
all users.  This is because GRASS looks for the user's default geographic
region definition settings and the location TITLE in files that are stored
under the PERMANENT mapset directory.  The <EM>g.access</EM> command,
therefore, will not allow you to restrict access to the PERMANENT mapset.

<P>
The <EM><A HREF="g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</A></EM> command isn't smart
enough to tell if access to a specified mapset is restricted, and the user
is therefore allowed to include the names of restricted mapsets in his
search path.  However, the data in a restricted mapset is still protected;
any attempts to look for or use data in a restricted mapset will fail.  The
user will simply not see any data listed for a restricted mapset.
