<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
This program is to be used in shell/perl/python scripts, so the author does not need to use <code>echo</code> program. Advantage of <code>g.message</code> is, that it formats messages just like other GRASS modules do and that it's functionality is influenced by <code>GRASS_VERBOSE</code> environment variable.
</p>
<p>
The program can be used for standard informative messages as well as warnings and fatal errors. For debugging purposes, flag <code>-d</code> will cause <code>g.message</code> to print level 1 debugging message.
