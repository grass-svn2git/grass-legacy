<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
This program is to be used in shell/perl/python scripts, so the author does not
need to use <code>echo</code> program. The advantage of <em>g.message</em> is
that it formats messages just like other GRASS modules do and that its
functionality is influenced by the <code>GRASS_VERBOSE</code> environment variable.
</p>
<p>
The program can be used for standard informative messages as well as warnings 
(<b>-w</b> flag) and fatal errors (<b>-e</b> flag). For debugging
purposes, the <b>-d</b> flag will cause <em>g.message</em> to print level
<tt>1</tt> debugging message.
</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Messages containing "<tt>=</tt>" must use the <b>message=</b> syntax so the
parser doesn't get confused.
<P>
Messges containing '<tt>!</tt>' and '<tt>$</tt>' must use single 'quotes' to
avoid unwanted shell translation.
<P>
If you want a long message (mutli-line) to be dealt with as a single
paragraph, use a single call to <em>g.message</em> with text split in the
script using the backslash as the last character. (In shell scripts don't
close the "quote")
<P>
A blank line may be obtained with: <tt>g.message ""</tt>
<P>
Redundant whitespace will be stripped away.
