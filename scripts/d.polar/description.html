<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.polar</EM> calculates and displays a polar diagram of an
angle raster map such as aspect, wind direction, or flow.
<P>
The radius of the outer circle is defined by the total number
of pixels in the map. If the polar diagram does not reach the
outer circle, no data (NULL) pixels were found in the map.
<P>
The vector in the diagram points into the prevalent direction
of the angles, its length is defined by the power of this
direction.
<P>
As a side effect, the quality of the angle map can be derived from
the diagram. Strong spikes may indicate an over-representation of
the related angle(s) which happens in particular if integer maps
are used.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

If <EM>d.polar</EM> is used on an aspect map generated by
<EM>r.slope.aspect</EM>, the <EM>undef</EM> parameter should be
set to 0 to distinguish NO DATA (NULL) areas from areas where
aspect is undefined (i.e. flat areas).

<H2>REQUIREMENT</H2>

The module needs <A HREF="http://www.xgraph.org/">xgraph</a> to be installed.
Probably d.graph should be used instead.
