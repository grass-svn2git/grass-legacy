<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em><b>r.mask</b></em> - Facilitates creation of a raster "MASK" map to
control raster operations.

<!-- a bit of repetition here, requires some consolidation -->

The MASK will block out certain areas of a raster map from analysis, by
"hiding" them from sight of other GRASS modules. While a mask exists, most
GRASS raster modules will operate only on data falling inside the masked
area, and ignore any data falling outside of the mask (those will be treated
as if their values were NULL).

<P>
<em>r.mask</em> uses <em>r.reclass</em> to create a reclassification of an
existing raster map and name it MASK. The user can select cat values to use
in the MASK.

<P>
Because the mask is actually only a reclass map named "MASK", it can be
copied, renamed, removed, and used in analyses, just like other GRASS
raster map layers.  The user should be aware that a mask remains in
place until a user renames it to something other than "MASK", or removes
it using "<tt>r.mask -r</tt>" or <EM><A HREF="g.remove.html">g.remove</A></EM>.

<p>
As long as the file named MASK exists in the current mapset, most
raster operations will only take place in the grid cells specified by
the MASK. Grid cells in the MASK map containing <tt>0</tt> or <tt>NULL</tt>
will replace data with NULL, cells containing other values will allow
data to pass through unaltered.

<p>
To restore raster operations to normal (i.e., all cells of the current region),
remove the MASK file by setting the <B>-r</B> remove MASK flag.
A MASK also can&nbsp;be removed by using <em><a href="g.remove.html">g.remove</a></em>
or by renaming it to any other name with <em><a href="g.rename.html">g.rename</a></em>.


<H2>NOTES</H2>

The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem
counterintuitive.  Areas inside the mask are not hidden;
areas outside the mask will be ignored until the MASK file
is removed.

<P>
Somewhat similar program functions to those performed by
<EM>r.mask</EM> can be done using
<EM><A HREF="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM>, 
<EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>,
and other programs.
