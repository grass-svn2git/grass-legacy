<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.what.vect</em> is used to transfer vector attributes from a query vector
map into a vector point map at the point positions. The script is based on
<em>v.distance</em>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The upload column into which the query results are stored must be present
in the vector point map or added with <em>v.db.addcol</em>.
<p>
This module only uploads attributes which exist at the exact positions of
the input points. For a "nearest feature" fit use <em>v.distance</em> instead.
<P>
In case of a multipoint input map (several points having the same category number),
it can happen that the query result is NULL if the same category number
falls into different polygons.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

In this example, the 'archsites' point map in the Spearfish location is copied
to the current mapset, a new attribute column is added and the owner
names from the 'fields' polygon map are transferred to the 'myarchsites'
map at point positions:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy vect=archsites,myarchsites
v.db.addcol myarchsites col="owner varchar(25)"
v.what.vect myarchsites qvect=fields column=owner qcolumn=label
# verification:
v.db.select myarchsites
</pre></div>
