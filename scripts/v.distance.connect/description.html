<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.distance.connect</em> creates connecting vector lines from vector
points to the nearest points found on a lines layer (point to line
connections).

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The map 'streets' be a line street network and the map 'schools' a
points map of school locations which are not on the network. To
generate a connecting lines map layer which connects the schools
points to the network at shortest distance to the next street,
run:

<br>
<tt>v.distance.connect input1=streets input2=schools output=connect</tt>
<P>
The resulting map may be patched into the 'streets' map with
<em>v.patch</em>
