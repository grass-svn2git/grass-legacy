<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.extension</em> downloads and installs extensions from 
GRASS Addons SVN repository into the local GRASS installation.
<p>
Re-running the script on an installed GRASS Addon re-installs
the requested extension which may include updates.
<p>
If your GRASS_ADDON_PATH contains more than one path, the default
action is to use the first directory in the list.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Download and install <em>i.landsat.toar</em> into current GRASS installation:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension extension=i.landsat.toar
</pre></div>


<h2>BUGS</h2>
This is a new module and obtaining successful behavior on all platforms
is rather tricky.  Please report any problems to the GRASS bug tracker.
If this automatic build fails, instructions for compiling both the GRASS
source code and GRASS addons by hand can be found in the GRASS wiki.
