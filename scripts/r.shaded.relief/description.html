<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.shaded.relief</EM> is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script that
creates a raster shaded relief map based on current
resolution settings and on sun altitude, azimuth, and z-exaggeration values
entered by the user.  The new shaded relief map is
named <EM>&lt;elevation&gt;.shade</EM> and stored in the user's current
mapset.  The map is assigned a grey-scale color table.


<P>

If no parameters are provided on startup, this program is interactive;
thus if the user enters the command:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>r.shaded.relief</B>
</DL>

The program then prompts the user to enter values for:
<OL>
<LI>The <B>altitude</B> of the sun in degrees above the horizon
(a value between 0 and 90 degrees), and

<LI>The <B>azimuth</B> of the sun in degrees to the east of north
(a value between 0 and 360 degrees).

<LI>The name of a raster map layer whose cell category values are to
provide <B>elevation</B> values for the shaded relief map.  Typically, this
would be a map layer of elevation;  however, any raster map layer
can be named.

<LI>The scaling parameter, which compensates for a different horizontal
<B>scale</B> than vertical scale. If 'scale' is a number then the ewres 
and nsres are multiplied by that scale to calculate the shading. (Default=1.0 
for equivalent horizontal and vertical scales.)

<LI>For the special case when a latitude-longitude projection is used 
with an elevation map measured in meters or feet, the <B>units</B> can
be set to automatically set the horizontal scale to the the number of 
meters or feet in a degree of latitude. The script scales latitude and 
longitude equally, so it's only approximately right, but for shading 
it's close enough. It makes the difference between a usable and unusable shade.
<br>For ETOPO2 data a scale factor of 10000 generates an acceptable
shading effect.

<LI>A z exaggeration factor that changes the apparent <B>relief</B> 
for the shaded relief map.  This can be any positive (or negative) 
floating point value. (Default=1.0)

</OL>

Specifically, <EM>r.shaded.relief</EM> executes a  
<EM><A HREF="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM>
statement. Refer to the manual entry for 
<EM><A HREF="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM> for an explanation
of the filtering syntax shown in the above expression.
See, for example, the section on "The Neighborhood Modifier".


<P>

<EM>r.shaded.relief</EM> then runs <EM><a href="r.colors.html">r.colors</A></EM>
to assign a grey-scale color table to the new shaded relief map.

This program is simply a shell script.  Users are encouraged to make their
own shell scripts using similar techniques.
