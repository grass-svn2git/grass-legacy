<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.oif</EM> calculates the Optimum Index Factor for LANDSAT TM bands 1,2,3,4,5 and 7.
<P>
The Optimum Index Factor is calculated to determine the band combination which
shows the maximum information when combined into a composite image. The bands
comprising the highest scoring combination from <EM>i.oif</EM> are used as the 
three color channels required for <EM><A HREF="d.rgb.html">d.rgb</A></EM> or
<EM><A HREF="r.composite.html">r.composite</A></EM>.
<P>
The analysis is saved to a file in the current directory called "i.oif.result".

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Colour Composites in BGR order: important band combinations (example: 
234 in BGR order means: B=2, G=3, R=4):

<ul>
<li> 123: near natural ("true") colour; however, because of correlation of the 3 bands in visible 
      spectrum, this combination contains not much more info than is contained in single band.
<li> 234: sensitive to green vegetation (portrayed as red), coniferous as distinctly darker
      red than deciduous forests. Roads and water bodies are clear.
<li> 243: green vegetation is green but coniferous forests aren't as clear as in the 234 combination
<li> 247: one of the best for info pertaining to forestry. Good for operation scale mapping of
      recent harvest areas and road construction.
<li> 345: contains one band from each of the main reflective units (vis, nir, shortwave infra).
      Green vegetation is green and the shortwave band shows vegetational stress and mortality.
      Roads are less evident as band 3 is blue.
<li> 347: similar to 345 but depicts burned areas better.
<li> 354: appears more like a colour infrared photo.
<li> 374: similar to 354.
<li> 457: shows soil texture classes (clay, loam, sandy).
</ul>
