<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.colors.stddev</EM> set raster map color rules based on standard
deviations from a map's mean value, either as a continuous color gradient
or in color bands per standard deviation from the mean.

<p>
With the color band option values less that 1 S.D. from the mean are
colored green, within 1-2 S.D. are colored yellow, within 2-3 S.D. are
colored red, and beyond 3 S.D. are colored black.
<p>
For a differences map there is an option to lock the center of the color
table at zero. Values more than two S.D. below the mean will be colored blue;
values below the mean but less than 2 S.D. away will transition to white,
and above the mean the colors will simularly transition to full red at +2 S.D.
