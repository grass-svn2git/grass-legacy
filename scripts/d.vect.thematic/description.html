<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM><b>d.vect.thematic</b></EM>  - Creates thematic vector maps of all types
from numeric attributes stored in data tables connected to a vector map file. Thematic
maps are displayed by either a graduated color scheme (for all vector  types),
or as graduated icon sizes (for point and centroid types). The user can select
the vector file to be mapped and attribute column from which to derive mapping
intervals, optionally a data table (if different from the vector file name) and
layer for attribute data, an options related to the type of thematic mapping
desired. A simple text legend is printed. <br>
<EM>(GRASS Shell Script)</EM>

<H2>ATTENTION</H2>

The algorithm currently uses the script <EM><A HREF="v.univar.sh.html">v.univar.sh</A></EM>
to calculate basic descriptive statistics needed for thematic mapping (minimum,
maximum, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles).
