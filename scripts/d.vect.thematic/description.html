<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM><b>d.vect.thematic</b></EM>  - Creates thematic vector maps of all types
from numeric attributes stored in data tables connected to a vector map file.
Thematic maps are displayed by either a graduated color scheme (for all vector
types), or as graduated icon sizes (for point and centroid types). The user can
select the vector file to be mapped and attribute column from which to derive
mapping intervals, 
(optionally) the layer for attribute data, and options related to the type of
thematic mapping desired. A simple text legend is printed. Optionally, a graphic
legend can be drawn in the selected display monitor. Thematic colors can be uploaded
to a GRASSRGB column for later display (areas only) and thematic map display
commands can be saved to a group file (*.dm) that can be opened, edited, and
displayed in the GIS Manager. <br>

<H2>ATTENTION</H2>

The algorithm currently uses the script <EM><A HREF="v.univar.sh.html">v.univar.sh</A></EM>
to calculate basic descriptive statistics needed for thematic mapping (minimum,
maximum, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles).
