<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM><b>v.rast.stats</b></EM>  - Calculates basic univariate statistics from
a raster map only for the parts covered by the specified vector map.
The vector map will be rasterized according to the raster map resolution.
Then univariate statistics are calculated per vector category (cat) from
the raster map and the results uploaded to the vector map attribute table.
New columns are generated in the attribute table if not already present.
<p>
Six columns are generated (n, min, max, range, mean, stddev, variance, 
coeff_var, sum) according to the output of <em>r.univar</em>.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Unless not specified, the script stops if a (prefixed) upload column is already
present in the vector map attribute table.
<p>
If a MASK is present, it will be restored after the script finished.
The scripts changes temporarily to the resolution of the given raster map.
