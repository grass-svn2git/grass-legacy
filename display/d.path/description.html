<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.path</em> enables shortest path vector networking - based on DGLib
(Directed Graph Library) vector network library  
(see <a href="http://mpa.itc.it/radim/g51/d.path.jpg">screenshot</a>). 
Costs may be either line lengths, or attributes saved in a database 
table. Supported are cost assignments for both arcs and nodes, and also different in both 
directions of a vector line. For areas cost will be calculated along boundary
lines. 

<h2>NOTE</h2>

The user needs to display a vector map before using d.path. The 'from' and 'to'
points are entered by mouse into the map displayed in the GRASS monitor.
The actions bound to the mouse buttons are described in the terminal
window when running the command.
<P>
To calculate shortest path non-interactively, the module <em>v.net.path</a>
must be used.
