<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.where</EM> is an <EM>interactive</EM> program that
allows the user, using the pointing device (mouse), to
identify the geographic coordinates associated with point
locations within the current geographic region in the
active display frame on the graphics monitor.

<P>

If the user runs <EM>d.where</EM> without specifying the
name of a spheroid on the command line, each mouse click
will output the easting and northing of the point
currently located beneath the mouse pointer.  A
mouse-button menu is presented so the user knows which
mouse buttons to use. The output is always printed to the
terminal screen; if the output is redirected into a file,
it will be written to the file as well.

<P>
Mouse buttons:

<pre>
     Left:   where am i
     Middle: draw to/from here
     Right:  quit this
</pre>

The left mouse button prints the coordinates at the selected point,
the middle mouse button allows to query two points (they are connected by a
line for convenience). By using the right mouse button the module is left.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program uses the current geographic region setting and active frame. 
It is not necessary, although useful, to have displayed a map in the current 
frame before running <EM>d.where</EM>. The <em>-d</em> flag allows to
optionally output latitude/longitude coordinates pair(s) in decimal degree
rather than DD:MM:SS format. In other projections the flag is silently
ignored.
