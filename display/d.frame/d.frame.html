<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program manages display frames on the user's graphics
monitor.  GRASS display programs at run-time connect with
graphics rendering programs.  While the display programs
are identical on every hardware platform, the graphics
rendering programs are (essentially the only GRASS
programs) designed for individual hardware devices. These
rendering programs are managed with the GRASS program
<EM><A HREF="d.mon.html">d.mon</A>.</EM> Graphics
are displayed in rectangular frames on whatever graphics
monitor the user is currently directing GRASS display
output to.  These frames are created and managed with this
program, Note that GRASS frame contents <EM>are not</EM>
retained when one frame covers another. You cannot
shuffle frames from top to bottom and then back again.
They simply define rectangular areas on the screen where
subsequent drawing will occur.  

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The coordinates for the <B>at=</B> option are stated in the form: 
<EM>bottom,top,left,right</EM>. The lower-left corner of the graphics 
monitor always is at location 0,0 while the monitor's upper-right 
corner is always at 100,100 (the values are in percent). 
<P>
If the user has created multiple display frames that overlap one another, 
whatever the user displays in the active frame will overwrite 
those portions of the underlying frame where these frames overlap. 
<P>
A frame by the name of <EM>full_screen</EM> is always present and may be
selected at any time. This may be useful if you would like to de-select
all user defined frames as you might do just before taking a screenshot.
