<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program manages display frames on the user's graphics
monitor. Graphics are displayed in rectangular frames on whatever graphics
monitor the user is currently directing GRASS display
output to.  These frames are created and managed with this
module. Note that GRASS frame contents <EM>are not</EM>
retained when one frame covers another. You cannot
shuffle frames from top to bottom and then back again.
They simply define rectangular areas on the screen where
subsequent drawing will occur.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The coordinates for the <B>at=</B> option are stated in the form: 
<EM>bottom,top,left,right</EM>. The lower-left corner of the graphics 
monitor always is at location 0,0 while the monitor's upper-right 
corner is always at 100,100 (the values are in percent). 
<P>
If <B>at=</B> options are not given during frame correction the
user will be prompted to create the frame using the mouse.
Likewise if a frame name is not given during frame selection, the user
will be prompted to select an existing frame on the display monitor
using the mouse.
<P>
If the user has created multiple display frames that overlap one another, 
whatever the user displays in the active frame will overwrite 
those portions of the underlying frame where these frames overlap. 
<P>
A frame by the name of <EM>full_screen</EM> is always present and may be
selected at any time. This may be useful if you would like to de-select
all user defined frames just before taking a screenshot.
