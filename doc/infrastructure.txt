== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* http://grass.fbk.eu
** 3Ghz Dual Core Pentium, sponsored by FBK-irst (formerly ITC-irst), Trento, Italy
** Apache Server with PHP
** OS: RHEL4 with overnight security updates
* http://grass.osgeo.org
** OSGeo infrastructure (http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/SAC)
* http://www.grass-gis.org
** Apache rewrite engine to http://grass.osgeo.org

* Web pages:
** hosted in the CVS server (developers can modify), downloaded to Web server
   via cronjob hourly
** written in simple PHP/HTML (just include() statement for menus)
** mirrored to selected tier-1 sites via rsync (hardcoded IPs to avoid
   that too many sites connect at grass.fbk.eu)
** tier-1 sites are mirrored via rsync to tier-2 mirrors (no hardcoded IPs)
** RSS feed: rss.xml file stored in CVS-Web
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo Drupal 12/2007

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** Source code tarball of CVS HEAD
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz is moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual (http://mpa.fbk.eu/markus/grass63progman/):
** HTML: cronjob run Saturday morning Italian time
** PDF: currently broken since PDFs aren't created for unknown reasons in cronjob
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* i18N translation statistics:
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* GRASS 5 tutorial (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** downloaded to Web server via cronjob
** built with docbook
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* GRASS user map
** GDF is creating png output via mapserver
** fetched every three hours via cronjob from http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/tmp/

* GRASS-Mapserver demo
** currently broken after grass.fbk.eu update

* Search engine
** htdig runs once a week
** searchgrass.inc contains selective entries (CVS-Web)
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* FTP server
** no longer available due to security risk

* Mailman mailing lists + Spam filtering (at lists.osgeo.org since 11/2007)
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
** the open "weblist" operates as:
    User -> weblist at grass itc.it -> /etc/aliases -> 
           -> neteler.osgeo..gmail.com (for Spam filtering) -> FWD -> 
             -> grass-web at lists osgeo.org

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)
** manually done by MN and Intevation (into freegis.org FTP space)
** nightly backup at OSGeo.org

* Web statistics
** Webalizer (http://grass.fbk.eu/webalizer/) runs daily as cronjob
** Sitemeter: http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s24grassgis
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

Summary: The system should run almost autonomous.
