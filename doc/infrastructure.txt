How the GRASS Webserver and related infrastructure works

written by M. Neteler, $Date$

== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* http://grass.itc.it
* 3Ghz Dual Core Pentium, sponsored by ITC-irst, Trento, Italy
* Apache Server with PHP
* OS: RHEL4 with overnight security updates

* Web pages:
** hosted in the CVS server (developers can modify), downloaded to Web server
   via cronjob every three hours
** written in simple PHP/HTML (just include() statement for menus)
** mirrored to selected tier-1 sites via rsync (hardcoded IPs to avoid
   that too many sites connect)
** tier-1 sites are mirrored via rsync to tier-2 mirrors (no hardcoded IPs)

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** Source code tarball of CVS HEAD
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz is moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual:
** HTML: job manually run by M Neteler from time to time (not on grass.itc.it)
** PDF: currently broken since PDFs aren't created for unknown reasons in cronjob

* i18N translation statistics:
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table

* GRASS 5 tutorial (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** downloaded to Web server via cronjob
** built with docbook

* GRASS user map
** GDF is creating png output via mapserver
** fetched every three hours via cronjob from http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/tmp/

* GRASS-Mapserver demo
** currently broken after grass.itc.it update

* Search engine
** htdig runs once a week

* FTP server
** no longer available due to security risk

* Mailman mailing lists + Spam filtering
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** each incoming email first passes 'bogofilter', then a set of handwritten
   procmail rules filter standard rubbish
** 'bogofilter' is autotrained
** the few spams which arrive through the bugtracker or into the open 'weblist'
   are manually added to /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-spam folder
** bogofilter learn script which reads /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-spam and
   /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-ham runs every night via cronjob

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)
** manually done by MN and Intevation (into freegis.org FTP space)

* Webalizer (http://grass.itc.it/webalizer/ )
** runs daily as cronjob


Summary: The system should run almost autonomous.


== GRASS Wiki ==

Maintainer: Stephan Holl, Otto Dassau

* http://grass.gdf-hannover.de
* Mediawiki, sponsored by GDF Hannover, Germany
* requires registration to keep spammers out

Summary: The system should run almost autonomous. An eye must be
         be kept on people trying to spam the site


== GRASS Source code repository ==

Maintainer: Bernhard Reiter, Jan-Oliver Wagner

* intevation.de
* CVS, sponsored by Intevation GmbH, Germany


== GRASS Bugtracker ==

Maintainer: Bernhard Reiter, Jan-Oliver Wagner

* https://intevation.de/rt/webrt?q_queue=grass
* webRT, sponsored by Intevation GmbH, Germany
* spamassasin spamfilter
* reports are directly sent to GRASS Developers mailing list for notification


== GRASS Quality Control ==

Maintainer: Giulio Antoniol

* Realtime analysis is sent to: http://grass.itc.it/mailman/listinfo/grass-qa
