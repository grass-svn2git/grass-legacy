== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* http://grass.osgeo.org
** X Ghz X CPU, sponsored by Telascience.org at San Diego Supercomputer Center (USA).
** Hardware: Blade xblade14-2
   (http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status#Telascience_Blades
    http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/SAC)
** Software:
*** OS: Fedora Core release 4 (Stentz)
*** Apache Server with PHP
** Further addresses: http://www.grass-gis.org
*** Apache rewrite engine to http://grass.osgeo.org
** Notes: Since OSGeo-SAC doesn't want to hand out too many ssh accesses to the osgeo1 and osgeo2 machines, we moved grass.osgeo.org as
virtual host onto Telascience.org infrastructure (sharing with other OSGeo services there)

* Web pages:
** hosted in SVN server (developers can modify, see
   http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/WebPagesManagement),
   downloaded to Web server via cronjob hourly
** written in simple PHP/HTML (just include() statement for menus)
** mirrored to selected tier-1 sites via rsync (hardcoded IPs to avoid
   that too many sites connect at grass.osgeo.org)
** tier-1 sites are mirrored via rsync to tier-2 mirrors (no hardcoded IPs)
** RSS feed: rss.xml file stored in SVN-Web
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo Drupal (http://grass-dev.osgeo.net)

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning California time):
** Source code tarball of SVN HEAD
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz is moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual (http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass6_progman/):
** HTML: cronjob run Saturday morning California time
** PDF: cronjob run Saturday morning California time

* i18N translation statistics:
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table

* GRASS user map
** GDF server is creating PNG output via Mapserver
** fetched every three hours via cronjob from http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/tmp/

* GRASS-Mapserver demo
** currently broken after grass.osgeo.org update

* Search engine (TODO!!)
** htdig runs once a week
** searchgrass.inc contains selective entries (SVN-Web)
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* FTP server
** no longer available due to security risk

* Mailman mailing lists + greylisting (at lists.osgeo.org since 11/2007)
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
** the open "weblist" operates instead like this:
    User -> grass-web at lists osgeo.org -> greylisting -> Mailman

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files) (TODO!!)
** manually done by MN and Intevation (into freegis.org FTP space)
** nightly backup at OSGeo.org
** TODO: Establish solution via local cp on lists.osgeo.org (SAC ticket todo)

* Web statistics
** See URL at http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats
** OSGeo: awstats (http://download.osgeo.org/logs-bin/awstats.pl?config=grass.osgeo.org)
*** configuration at: /etc/awstats/awstats.grass.osgeo.org.conf
*** httpd logs: /var/log/httpd/grass_*
*** awstats processed log files: /osgeo/download/logs
*** cronjob script: /osgeo/scripts/update_logs.sh
** FBK Mirror: Webalizer (http://grass.fbk.eu/webalizer/) runs daily as cronjob
** Sitemeter: http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s24grassgis

Summary: The system should run almost autonomously.
