GRASS Debugging:
 Print debugging message if variable DEBUG
 is set to level equal or greater

g.gisenv set="DEBUG=3"

Levels: (recommended levels)
 * 0 - silence
 * 1 - message is printed once or few times per module
 * 3 - each row (raster) or line (vector)
 * 5 - each cell (raster) or point (vector)

> How can I force gcc, to complain about missing header file?
 
'-Wimplicit-function-declaration'
'-Werror-implicit-function-declaration'
     Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
     declared.

----------------------------------------------------

To make gcc less tolerant in accepting errors and code flaws, compile
with:

export CFLAGS='-g -ansi -Wall -D_BSD_SOURCE=1 -D_SVID_SOURCE=1 -D_POSIX_SOURCE=1 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L'

Also nice to emulate gcc/MacOSX compiler:
CFLAGS='-fno-common'

----------------------------------------------------
A good idea is maybe to use '-Wall -Werror' for the gcc options. This means
it treats the warnings as errors, i.e. it stops on them. So you have time
to read them then.

The gcc switch -Wimplicit-function-declaration (implied by -Wall) should
report missing prototypes (use -Werror-implicit-function-declaration to
make it an error rather than a warning).
 
The linker switch --warn-common (e.g. LDFLAGS='-Wl,--warn-common') might
be useful for catching multiply-defined symbols.
