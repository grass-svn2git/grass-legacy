Alternate Build Mechanism
 - uses GNU make (maybe others, not tested)
 - allows building in a separate directory
 - allows use of a read-only source directory for the actual build (although 
   write permission is required to generate the makefiles)

Building everything:

mkdir ~/grass-build
cd ~/grass-build
/usr/src/grass5/configure --enable-gmake=no ...
make all	# all == dirs gmake documents binaries links post-compile
sudo make install

Building a single directory:

mkdir ~/grass-build
cd ~/grass-build
/usr/src/grass5/configure --enable-gmake=no ...
make dirs gmake
./gmake5x <subdir>

Shared libraries are built by default. Use
/usr/src/grass5/configure --enable-gmake=no --enable-shared=no ...
for static libraries.
