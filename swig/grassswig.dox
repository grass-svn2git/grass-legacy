<h2>GRASS SWIG interface</h2>

GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is an open source,
Free Software Geographical Information System (GIS) with raster, topological
vector, image processing, and graphics production functionality that
operates on various platforms through a graphical user interface and shell
in X-Window. GRASS is released under GNU General Public License (GPL).
The GRASS SWIG interface partially released under X11/MIT License.

SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in
C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages.  SWIG is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as
Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, Ruby and PHP. The list of 
<a href="http://www.swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages">supported languages</a> also includes 
on-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, UFFI), Java, Modula-3 and OCAML. Also several
interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken)
are supported. SWIG is most
commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
software.  SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and
Lisp s-expressions.  SWIG may be freely used, distributed, and modified for commercial
and non-commercial use.

<h2>Status of GRASS SWIG implementation</h2>

At the moment a prototype is implemented. It permits to use 
the GRASS raster command <em>r.slope.aspect</em> directly
from the PERL programming language.
