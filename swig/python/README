What is this?
-------------
	 This is SWIG based python wrapping for GRASS API
which allows to call GRASS functions from python programs.
Currently only a limited set of functions (those needed for
me) are wrapped.


How to INSTALL?
---------------
1. Install SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
     http://www.swig.org

2. Be sure you configured GRASS with support for Python:
     ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python2.5-config

3. Run make in the swig/python/ directory

It will create two files, python_grass6.py and _python_grass6.so.

4. From within GRASS (or a fakegrass session) run "python test.py" to
   test and to automatically create a byte-compiled version of the module
   (python_grass6.pyc). The .pyc file is platform indepenent and may be
   safely shared among systems. Even so, it doesn't hurt to rebuild it
   ourselves while we still have write permissions and to make sure we
   are using an up to date copy. (out of data copies will be ignored)

5. It is useful to build the NumPtr module as well.
   - see README.GRASS in that directory for instructions

How to use it?
--------------

import python_grass6
GRASS functions will be available in this module.
Eg: 
	import python_grass6
	mapset=python_grass6.G_mapset()
	print mapset

See examples/m.distance for an example of a working SWIG-Python module.

More examples can be found on the GRASS Wiki site's Python page:
  http://grass.gdf-hannover.de/wiki/GRASS_and_Python#Python-SWIG-GRASS_interface


DEBUGGING
----------

gdb --args python <script.py>

e.g. 
    gdb --args python rasteraccess.py
