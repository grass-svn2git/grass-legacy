  How to migrate to the new GRASS version
  
  GRASS users may ask: how to continue to work with my existing locations
  in the new version... here some answers:
  
  Raster data
  
    Nothing to do. The raster commands behave (almost) the same.

  Sites data

    All sites data (related s.* commands) are now part of the vector
    engine and no longer stored in an own format.

    Conversion of old sites files to new GRASS 2D/3D vector point maps:
      
      * v.in.sites (for single old sites map)
      * v.in.sites.all (for all old sites maps in current mapset)
  
  Vector data
  
    The vector engine has been completely rewritten. All vector maps have
    to be converted
    
    Conversion of old vector maps to new GRASS 2D/3D vector maps:
      
      * v.convert (for single old vector map)
      * v.convert.all (for all old vector maps in current mapset)

    Note that g.list oldvect list the old vector maps which g.list vect
    lists the new vector maps.
    
    The module v.out.ogr and v.out.ascii can be used to export from new
    GRASS to old GRASS versions.
