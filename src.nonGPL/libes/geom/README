In contact with Ernst Mücke, we could find out the following:

Ernst is the principal author of detri, which includes lia, sos, basic.

He cannot change his old webpages at GeomDir anymore:
http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/GeomDir/welcome.html
http://www.geom.umn.edu/~mucke/GeomDir/
http://www.geom.umn.edu/~mucke/GeomDir/sos90.html

The latest detri code is available from:
	http://www.geocities.com/mucke/GeomDir/detri.html

detri_2.9www.tar.gz now has clarified texts showing
that Ernst's part of it (everything except part of basic) is free software!

The problem is, that we do not know the author of optri.
optri has a copyright notice of the University of Illinios (ui)
and there is no author named.

It probably was not the group which went out and took code for
a proprietory business model, just for the record:
