Code in this subdirectory currently cannot be distributed with GRASS
due to a uncompatible license. 

Possibilities:

	* copyright claimed, but license not clearly being Free Software
	* license not compatible with the GNU General Public License.

The parts will be replaced if there is enough interest and resources.

All this code used to be distributed in old grass archives.
In 1999 the then newly formed GRASS Development Team 
started to clean up the nebulous licensing status,
clearly wanting future GRASS version to be Free Software.

Part of the code found in this directory is based on:

-> use the src/libes/gmath/ library which is based on LAPACK/BLAS.
   It provides all required functions.
