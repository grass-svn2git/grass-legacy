INTRODUCTION

GRASS comes with numerous image processing modules. These
modules are based on
src/libes/imagery/
which was developed in the late '80th. 
An improved version of the library developed in the early '90th
is stored in
src/libes/image3/

Unfortunately this library was never finished but left in
an incomplete state. Only i.points3, i.rectify3 are based on it.

Additionally i.ortho.photo owns it's own library overlap to
the above mentioned libs:
src/imagery/i.ortho.photo/libes/


PROPOSOSALS

- cleanup of the src/libes/image3/ 
   note: src/libes/image3/crs.c has been added cleaned to GDAL as
         gdal/alg/gdal_crs.c
- merge needed functions from src/libes/imagery/
  into src/libes/image3/
- update functions in src/imagery/ modules
- move functions from src/imagery/ modules to library
  (clones removal)
- use doxygen to document the functions (docs are in Programmer's Manual
  in GRASS CVS)
