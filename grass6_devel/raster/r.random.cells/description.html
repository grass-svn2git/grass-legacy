<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.random.cells</em> generates a random sets of cells that are at
least <var>distance</var> apart. The cells are numbered from 1 to the
numbers of cells generated. Random cells will not be generated in areas
masked off.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>

<b>output </b> Output map: Random cells. Each random cell has a unique
non-zero cell value ranging from 1 to the number of cells generated. The
heuristic for this algorithm is to randomly pick cells until there are no
cells outside of the chosen cell's buffer of radius <b>distance</b>.
<p>

<b>distance</b> Input value(s) [default 0.0]: <b>distance</b> determines the
minimum distance the centers of the random cells will be apart.
<p>
<b>seed</b> Input value [default: random]: Specifies the random seed that
<em>r.random.cells</em> will use to generate the cells. If the random seed
is not given,<em> r.random.cells</em> will get a seed from the process ID
number.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The original purpose for this program was to generate independent random
samples of cells in a study area. The <b>distance</b> value is the amount of
spatial autocorrelation for the map being studied. The amount of spatial
autocorrelation can be determined by using <em>r.2Dcorrelogram</em> with
<em>r.2Dto1D</em>, or <em>r.1Dcorrelogram</em>. With <b>distance</b> set to
zero, the <b>output</b> map will number each non-masked cell from 1 to the
number of non-masked cells in the study region.
