<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html">Vis5D</a> is a system
for interactive visualization of large 5-D gridded data sets such as those
produced by numerical weather models. One can make isosurfaces, contour
line slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc of data in a 3-D grid,
then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a feature
for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text anotations for publications,
support for interactive data analysis, etc.
<br>r3.in.v5d imports 3-dimensional files (i.e. the v5d file with 1 variable
and 1 time step). Otherwise, only first variable and timestep from 4/5D
v5d file will be imported.
