The very beginning of a swig interface for Grass.
- Version 2 -

This is mainly Perl. Swig supports many languages, thus generic Swig
things should be separated and only Swig/Perl things left here.

Files:
 error.c:	error functions
 grass.i:	typemap
 typemaps.i:	typemap
 make.pl.in:	generates make.pl
 README:	you are reading this


Compiling this is done the usual perl way:

# this takes a while...
perl make.pl
make
make test

you won't need this for a very long time:
make install

What I've done:

1) the skeleton was created using h2xs

2) hand-edited grass.i and typemaps.i

It might be a good idea to create a thin header layer between the
actual Grass and Swig.

3) the job perl'izes all GRASS modules in raster/ and vector/
   (watch out for compilation errors)

Please extend and enjoy :)
