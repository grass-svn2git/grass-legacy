<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>g.ask</EM> is designed for shell scripts that need to
prompt the user for the name of a data base file in the
user's current GRASS location.  After <EM>g.ask</EM> is
invoked with needed parameters, it will query the user for
a file name of the specified <EM>type</EM> and
<EM>element</EM>.  After the user responds to this query,
the program will write four lines to the UNIX output file
specified by <EM>unixfile</EM>.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>


<DL>


<DT><B>type=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>The type of query.  Options for <EM>name</EM> are 
<EM>old</EM>, <EM>new</EM>,
<EM>any</EM>, and <EM>mapset</EM>;  their functions are given below.
"New", "any", and "mapset" only look in the user's current mapset.

<DL>
<DD>
<DT><B>old</B>
<DD>For existing data files anywhere in the user's mapset search path.

<DT><B>new</B> 

<DD>Used to create a new file in the current mapset, which must not
already exist there (if a file with this name exists there,
it will not be overwritten).

<DT><B>any</B> 

<DD>Creates a file in the current mapset, which may or may not
already exist there.  If a file with this name exists in the
current mapset, it will be overwritten;
if not, a new file with this name will be created.

<DT><B>mapset</B> 

<DD>For files that must exist in the current mapset
The shell write wants the name of a file which exists
in the user's current mapset.  This type would
used instead of "old" if the file is to be modified.
</DL>

<DT><B>prompt=</B>"<EM>string</EM>" 

<DD>The prompt to be displayed to the user.  If more than
one word, the prompt should be enclosed within double
quotes ("").

<DT><B>element=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>The name of the GRASS data base element (i.e.,
directory under a GRASS mapset) whose files are to be
queried.

<DT><B>desc=</B>"<EM>string</EM>" 

<DD>A short description of the data base element which is
meaningful to the user.  If description contains more than
one word, it should be enclosed within double quotes ("").

<DT><B>unixfile=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>The name of a UNIX file to store the user's response.
See next section for what is written to this file and how
it can be used by shell scripts.

<H2>OUTPUT</H2>

Upon receiving the user's response to its request for a
file name, <EM>g.ask</EM> writes four lines to the
specified <EM>unixfile</EM>; this output file is placed in
the user's current working directory, unless otherwise
specified, and contains the following lines:


<div class="code">
<PRE>
name='<EM>some_name</EM>'
mapset='<EM>some_mapset</EM>'
fullname='<EM>some_fullname</EM>'
file='<EM>some_fullpath</EM>'
</pre></div>

<P>

The output is <EM>/bin/sh</EM> commands to set the variable
<EM>name</EM> to the file name specified by the user (of
the <EM>element</EM> and <EM>type</EM> requested by
<EM>g.ask</EM>), <EM>mapset</EM> to the GRASS mapset in
which this file resides (or will be created),
<EM>fullname</EM> is the name with the mapset embedded in
it, and <EM>file</EM> to the full UNIX path name
identifying this file.  These variables may be set in the
<EM>/bin/sh</EM> as follows:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>. unixfile</B>
</DL>


<P>

The . is a shell command which means read the
<EM>unixfile</EM> and execute the commands found there.  It
is NOT part of the <EM>unixfile</EM> name and MUST be
followed by a space.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The user may choose to simply hit the return key and not enter a file name.
If this happens the variables will be set as follows:


<div class="code">
<PRE>
name=
mapset=
fullname=
file=
</pre></div>

<P>

The following is a way to test for this case:

<div class="code">
<PRE>
if [ ! "$file" ]
then
	exit
fi
</PRE></div>
