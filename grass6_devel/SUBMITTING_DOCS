Dear (new) GRASS Developer,

When submitting documentation to GRASS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING for C hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_SCRIPTS for shell script hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_TCLTK for tcl and tk hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_PYTHON for Python code hints ]


1. Editing of HTML pages
   To avoid insertion of too complicated HTML tags (see also below),
   we strongly suggest to use a plain text editor rather than a
   HTML editor for editing.


2. Module manual page:
   Place the documentation in HTML format into 'description.html'.
   The easiest way to do this is to study an existing HTML page
   (to get the page style, e.g. vector/v.to.db/description.html).
   With a few exceptions header and footer are NOT allowed.
   You can add figures (PNG format), the figure name prefix should be the 
   module name. See raster/r.terraflow/description.html for an example.

   Note that the parameter information is auto-generated upon
   compilation. This is done by running module in a virtual session
   after compilation (see the output of 'make'). To subsequently
   verify the final HTML page, check the resulting HTML pages which
   will be stored with the name of the module.

   Examples (please add some) should be coded like this:

   <div class="code"><pre>
   v.to.db map=soils type=area option=area col=area_size unit=h
   </pre></div>
 
   The online WWW man pages is updated every Saturday (from SVN
   repository).


3. Usage of limited HTML tags
   Since the MAN conversion of g.html2man is limited, please use
   no other HTML tags than:
   <A> <B> <BLINK> <BODY> <BR> <CODE> <DD> <DL> <DT> <EM> 
   <H2> <H3> <H4>  <HEAD> <HEADER> <HR> <I> <IMG> <LI> <OL> <P>
   <PRE> <SUP> <TABLE> <TD> <TH> <TITLE> <TR> <UL>


4. Suggested HTML markup protocol:
   Module names (i.e., v.category) should be emphsized with <em>,
   and boldface <b> for flags and parameter names. Shell commands, 
   names, values, etc. should use <tt>. Empahsized phrases should use 
   italics <i>. The SEE ALSO section of each page should also be 
   alphabetized. 	  		


5. When submitting new files to the repository set SVN properties,
   e.g. for HTML file
    
       svn:mime-type : text/html
       svn:keywords : Author Date Id
       svn:eol-style : native
