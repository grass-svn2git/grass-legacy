<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.generalize</EM>
is module for generalization of GRASS vector maps. This module
comprises a bunch of algortihms for line simplification, line smoothing,
network generalization and displacemet. (New methods may be added later)
Also, this document contains only the descriptions of module and implemented
methods. For more examples and nice pictures, check

<H2>NOTES</H2>
(Line) simplification is a process of reducing the compexity of vector features.
It transforms a line into another line which consists of fewer vertices but
still approximates the original line. The most of the algorithms described below
selects a subset of points of the original line.

<P>
On the other hand, (line) smoothing is a "reverse" process which takes as an
input a line and produces smoother line which approximates the original line.
In some cases, this is achieved by inserting new vertices into the line. 
Sometimes, the increase of the number of vertices is dramatical (4000%).
When this situation occurs, it is always a good idea to simplify the line after
smoothing.
</P>

<P>
Smoothing and simplification algorithms implemented in this module work line by 
line. i.e simplification/smoothing of one line does not affect the other lines.
They are treated separately.  Also, the first and the last point of each line is
never translated and/or deleted. 
</P>

<H2>SIMPLIFICATION</H2>
<P>
<EM>v.generalize</EM> contains following line simplification algorithms
<UL>
<LI>Douglas-Peucker Algorithm</LI>
<LI>"Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm"</LI>
<LI>Lang Algorithm</LI>
<LI>Vertex Reduction</LI>
<LI>Reumann-Witkam Algorithm</LI>
<LI>Remove Small Lines/Areas</LI>
</UL>

Different algorithms require different parameters, but all the algorithms have
one parameter in common. It is <B>threshold</B> parameter. In general, the degree
of simplification increases with the increasing value of <B>threshold</B>.<BR>

The following happens if <B>r</B> flag is presented.
If some line is simplified and hence becomes shorter than <B>threshold</B> then it is
removed. Also, if <B>type</B> contains <B>area</B> and a simplification algorithm is selected,
the areas of area less than <B>threshold</B> are also removed.

<H2>DETAIL DESCRIPTION</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <I>Douglas-Peucker</I> - "Quicksort" of line simplification, the most widely used
     algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. For more
     information, please check: <A href="http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm">http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</I> is essentially the same algorithm as the
     algorithm above. The difference is that it takes additional parameter <B>reduction</B> 
     which denotes the percentage of the number of points on the new line with respect 
     to the number of points on the original line. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, 
     <B>threshold</B>, <B>reduction</B>.</LI>     
<LI> <I>Lang</I> - Another standard algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>. 
     For an excellent description, check: <A href="http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm">http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Vertex Reduction</I> - Simplest among the algorithms. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>.
     Given line, this algorithm removes the points of this line which are closer to each other than <B>threshold</B>.
     Precisely, if p1 and p2 are two consecutive points and distance between p2 and p1 is less
     than <B>threshold</B>, it removes p2 and repeats the same
     process on the remaining points.</LI>
<LI> <I>Reuman-Witkam</I> - Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithm quite
     reasonably preserves the global characteristics of the lines. For more information
     check <A href="http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html">http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html</A>(german)</LI>
<LI> <I>Remove Small Lines/Areas</I> - removes the lines (strictly) shorter than threshold and areas of area (strictly)less than threshold.
     Other lines/areas/boundaries are left unchanged. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>             
</UL>

<P>
<I>Douglas-Peucker</I> and <I>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</I> use the same method
to simplify the lines. Note that 
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas threshold=eps
</PRE></DIV>
is equivalent to
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas_reduction threshold=eps reduction=100
</PRE></DIV>
However, in this case, the first method is faster. Also observe that
<I>douglas_reduction</I> never outputs more vertices than <I>douglas</I>. And that,
in general, <I>douglas</I> is more efficient than <I>douglas_reduction</I>.
More importantly, the effect of
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas_reduction threshold=0 reduction=X
</PRE></DIV>
is that 'out' contains approximately only X% of points of 'in'.
</P>

<H2>SMOOTHING</H2>
<P>
The following smoothing algorithms are implemented in <EM>v.generalize</EM>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Boyle's Forward-Looking Algorithm</I> - The position of each point depends on the
    position of the previous points and the point <B>look_ahead</B> ahead. 
    <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.</LI>
<LI><I>McMaster's Sliding Averaging Algorithm</I> - Input Parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>slide</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.
    The new position of each point is the average of the <B>look_ahead</B> points around. Paremeter <B>slide</B>
    is used for linear interpolation between old and new position (see below).</LI>     
<LI><I>McMaster's Distance-Weighting Algorithm</I> - Works by taking the weighted average of <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points
    where the weight is the reciprocal of the distance from the point to the currently smoothed point. And parameter <B>slide</B> is used
    for linear interpolation between the original position of the point and newly computed position where value 0 means the original position.
    Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>slide</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.
    </LI>
<LI><I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> - "Inscribes" a line touching the original line such that the points on this new line
    are at least <I>threshold</I> apart. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithm
    approximates given line very well.</LI>
<LI> <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> - This algorithm takes the points of the given line as the control
     points of hermite cubic spline and approximates this spline by the points approximatelly <B>threshold</B> apart.
     This method has excellent results for the small values of <B>threshold</B>, but in this case it produces
     a huge number of new points and some simplification is usually needed. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <B>angle_thresh</B>.
     <B>Angle_thresh</B> is used for reducing the number of the outputed points. It denotes the minimal
     angle (in degrees) between two consecutive segements of line.</LI>     
<LI> <I>Snakes</I> is the method of minimization of the "energy" of the line. This method preserves the
     general characteristcs of the lines but smooths the "sharp corners" of the line. Input parameters <B>input</B>, <B>alpha</B>, <B>beta</B>.
     This algorithm works very well for small values of <B>alpha</B> and <B>beta</B> (between 0 and 5). These
     parameters affects the "sharpness" and the curvature of the computed line.</LI>                          
</UL>
<P>
One of the key advantages of <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> is the fact that the computed line
always passes throught the points of the original line whereas the lines produced by the 
remaining algorithms never pass through these points. In some sense, this algorithm outputs
the line which "circumsrcibes" given line. On the other hand, <I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> outputs
the line which "inscribes" given line. Moreover this line always touches/intersects the centre
of the line segment between two consecutive points. For more iterations, the property above does
not hold, but the computed lines are very similar to the Bezier Splines. The disadvantage of these
two algorithm is that they increase the number of points. However, <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> can be used
as another simplification algorithm. To achieve this, it is necessary to set <I>angle_thresh</I> to higher values (15 or so). 
</P>
<P>
One restriction on both McMasters' Algorithms is that <I>look_ahead</I> parameter must be odd. Also
note that these algorithms have no effect if <I>look_ahead = 1</I>. 
</P>
<P>
Note that <I>Boyle's</I>, <I>McMasters'</I> and <I>Snakes</I> algorithm are sometime used in the signal processing to smooth the signals.
More importantly, these algorithms never change the number of points on the lines. i.e they only
translate the points, they do not insert any new points. 
</P>
<P>
<I>Snakes</I> Algorithm is (asymptotically) the slowest among the algorithms presented above. Also,
it requires quite a lot of memory. This means, that it is not very efficient
for maps with the lines consisting of many segments.
</P>

<H2>DISPLACEMENT</H2>
<P>
The displacement is used when the lines (linear
features) interact (overlap and/or are close to each other) at the current
level of detail. In general, displacement methods, as name suggests, move the
conflicting features apart so that they do not interact and can be distinguished.   
</P>
<P>
This module implements algorithm for displacement of linear features based on
the <I>Snakes</I> approach. This method has very good results. However, it
requires a lot of memory and is not very efficient.
</P>
<P>
Displacement is selected by method=displacement. It uses following parameters:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>threshold</B> - specifies critical distance. Two features interact iff they are
closer than <B>threshold</B> appart.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>alpha</B>, <B>beta</B> - These parameters define the rigidity of lines. For greater
values of <B>alpha</B>, <B>beta</B> (&gt;=1), the algorithm better preserves the original
shape of the lines. On the other hand, the lines may not
be move enough.  If the values of <B>alpha</B>, <B>beta</B> are too small (&lt;=0.001)
then the lines are moved sufficiently, but the geometry and topology of lines can
be destroyed. Probably, the best way to find the good values of <B>alpha</B>, <B>beta</B>
is by trial and error.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>iterations</B> - denotes the number of iterations the interactions between
the lines are resolved. Mostly, good values of <B>iterations</B> lies
between 10 and 100.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The lines affected by the algorithm can be specified by the <B>layer</B>,
<B>cats</B> and <B>where</B> parameters.
</P>
<!-- TODO: example(s) -->

<H2>NETWORK GENERALIZATION</H2>
<P>
Is used for selecting "the most important" part of the network. This is based
on the graph algorithms. Network generalization is applied if method=network.
The algorithm calculates three centrality measures for each line in the
network and only the lines with the values greater than thresholds are selected.
The behaviour of algorithm can be altered by the following parameters:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>degree_thresh</B> - algorithm selects only the lines which share a point
with at least <B>degree_thresh</B> different lines.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>closeness_thresh</B> - is always in the range (0, 1]. Only the lines with
the closeness centrality measure at least <B>closeness_thresh</B> are selcted. 
The lines in the centre of a network have greater values of this measure then
the lines near the border of a network. This means,
that this parameters can be used for selecting the centre(s) of a network. Note that
if closeness_thresh=0 then everything is selected.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>betweeness_thresh</B> - Again, only the lines with betweeness centrality
measure at least <B>betweeness_thresh</B> are selected. This value is always
positive and is larger for large networks. It denotes to what extent a line
is in between the other lines in the network. This value is great for the lines
which lie between other lines and lie on the paths between two parts of a network.
In the terminology of the road neworks, these are highways, bypasses, main roads/streets.... 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All three parameters above can be presented at the same time. In that case,
the algorithm selects only the lines which meet each criterion. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the outputed network may not be connected if the value of <B>betweeness_thresh</B>
is too large.
