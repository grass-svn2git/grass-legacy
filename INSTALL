                   INSTALL GRASS 5.7.x source code

Please read *all* text below.

Note: We use synonymical:
      grass50 == grass50x == grass53x

CURRENT STATUS

The GRASS 5.7.x code repository currently contains only the new 3D/DBMS
vector library and a few rewritten vector modules as well as a subset of
merged 5.3.x modules.

To compile the 5.7.x code, source code from 5.3.x is needed (the CVS HEAD
version), which is automatically linked then into the 5.7.x directory
structure. In future we continue to migrate further code into the 5.7.x
directory structure.

Because of that the source code of GRASS 5.3.x is needed. When
running "configure" the  full path to grass50/ has to be specified.


COMPILATION

CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure \
   --with-grass50=/full/path/to/grass50(MAIN)/source
make mix   
make       

Optionaly it is possible to copy binary modules from compiled 5.3.x by:
make binmix

Explanation of options:
--with-grass50    must be full path to MAIN (=experimental) branch (not 
                  release) of GRASS 5.3.x. Make it an *absolute* path, not a
                  relative path.

Explanation of all targets:
make mix           - create symbolic links to grass50 for file not yet 
                      uploaded into the 5.7.x CVS repository
make copymix       - copy files from grass50
make binmix        - Copy binary modules not yet updated to 5.7.x 
                      from compiled 5.3.x

make install       - TODO

make bindist       - make a binary package with install script
make srcdist       - make a source package for distribution (including the
                     5.3.0 files)

make clean         - delete all files created by 'make' 
make distclean     - 'make clean' + delete all files created by './configure'
make mixclean      - delete all symbolic links created by make mix


INSTALLATION (first time)

After compilation, the resulting code is in the directory
./dist.$ARCH
and the scripts (grass57, ...) in
./bin.$ARCH

To run GRASS 5.7.x, simply start
./bin.$ARCH/grass57

Note that most modules from GRASS 5.3.x are missing. However, they
can be easily linked into the ./dist.$ARCH structure if needed.
Or, new directories with new Makefiles must be added and the
directory defined in ./tools/link.conf.


UPDATE OF 5.7.x

Assuming that you want to update your current installation from
CVS, you have to perform a couple of steps. In general:

- clean the links to 5.3.x
- update from 5.3.x CVS HEAD (the 5.3.x code)
- update from 5.7.x CVS (the 5.7.x code)
- recreate the links to 5.3.x (make mix)
- configure, compile

In detail:

cd /where/your/grass530/lives/
cvs update -dP

cd /where/your/grass57/lives/
make mixclean
cvs update -dP
make mix
configure ...
make


SUPPORT

Note that this code is quite experimental. Without announcement the
vector structure can change. But usually it will be possible to upgrade
the data set. DO NOT USE THIS VERSION FOR PRODUCTION.
