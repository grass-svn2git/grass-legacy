<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program converts a GRASS raster file to a TIFF raster file. Output may
be 8 or 24 bit (TrueColor).  Optionally, a TIFF World file compatible with
ESRI's and other's products may be output.

<P>
The program prompts the user for the name of a GRASS raster file, an output
TIFF file, whether an 8 or 24 bit format is desired, and whether or not to
create a TIFF world file.  Currently only uncompressed, packpit, or deflate
TIFF files are written.  These output formats are known to be compatible
with r.in.tiff.
<p>
When writing with "-l" option, tiles are written at 128x128 pixels.  For
programs that can utilize tiles, it can help speed up some drawing
operations.

<P>
The user may adjust region and resolution before export using
<EM>g.region</EM>.
