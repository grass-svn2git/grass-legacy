<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The program <EM>r.random</EM> allows the user to create a
raster map layer and a vector points map containing 
coordinates of points whose locations have been randomly
determined.  The program locates these randomly generated
sites (vector points) within the current geographic region and mask (if
any), on non-zero category value data areas within a
user-specified raster map layer.  If the user sets the
<B>-z</B> flag, sites will be randomly generated across all
cells (even those with NULL values).

<P>

The <EM>raster_output</EM> raster map layer is created in
the user's current mapset.  The category values and
corresponding category names already associated with the
random vector point locations in the <EM>input</EM> map layer are
assigned to these sites in the <EM>raster_output</EM> map
layer. If the <B>-z</B> is specified, then a unique entry
is made for the value used where the <EM>input</EM> was NULL.
This value is at least 1 less than the smallest value in the
<EM>input</EM> raster and is given a medium gray color.

<P>

The <EM>vector_output</EM> file created by <EM>r.random</EM>
contains a listing of the sites' coordinates;
these coordinates are the <EM>center points</EM> of the
randomly selected cells.  A double attribute contains the cell value
of the <EM>input</EM> raster (or the assigned value
when <B>-z</B> is used.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The user may specify the quantity of random locations to be
generated either as a <EM>positive integer</EM> (e.g., 10),
or as a <EM>percentage of the raster map layer's cells</EM> 
(e.g., 10%, or 3.05%).  The number of cells considered for 
the percentage reflects whether or not the <B>-z</B> flag
was given.   Options are 0-100; percentages less than
one percent may be stated as decimals.  

<P>

<EM>r.random</EM> can be run interactively or
non-interactively.  The user may provide program arguments
on the command line, specifying an input map layer name
(<B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>), output raster map layer name
(<B>raster_output=</B><EM>name</EM>), output vector points map
name (<B>vector_output=</B><EM>name</EM>), and 
the number of sites to be randomly generated as a
total number of sites (<B>n=</B><EM>number</EM>) or as
a percentage of the map's size
(<B>n=</B><EM>number</EM><B>%</B>).  The user can also
direct that <EM>r.random</EM> run quietly (using the
<B>-q</B>)</EM> option, and/or direct <EM>r.random</EM> to
also generate random vector point locations against cells
containing NULL values (using the <B>-z</B> option).  The
<B>-i</B> can be used to get a count of the total cells and
NULL cells given the current region settings.

<P>

Alternately, the user can simply type <B>r.random</B> on the command line 
without program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted for 
needed inputs and option choices using the standard GRASS 
<EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></EM>
interface.

<P>

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>Run quietly. <EM>r.random</EM> will normally print
output messages to standard output as it runs. The
<B>-q</B> option will suppress the printing of these
messages.

<DT><B>-z</B>

<DD>Include NULL cells in the pool
from which <EM>r.random</EM> will randomly generate vector point locations. 

<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>Print the raster map's name and location, 
the total number of cells under the current region settings, and
the number of NULL valued cells under the current region settings.
Then exit without doing anything.  Useful for deciding on the number
of sites to have <EM>r.random</EM> create.

<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>Generate vector points with 3D geometry instead of 2D geometry.
The z values correspond to the raster map values. 
</DL>

<P>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>An existing raster map layer in the user's current mapset search path. 
<EM>r.random</EM> will randomly generate sites on a user-specified portion 
of the cells in this <EM>input</EM> raster map. 
<DT><B>n=</B><EM>number</EM>
<DD>Specify the quantity of sites to be randomly generated as 
either a <EM>positive</EM> integer</B>, or 
as a <EM>percentage</EM> value</B> of the number of cells in the <EM>input</EM> map layer. 
If stated as a positive integer, <EM>number</EM> is 
the number of sites (i.e., number of cells) to appear 
in the <EM>raster_output</EM> layer and/or <EM>vector_output</EM> file. 
<BR>
Options: Non-percentage values should be given as positive integer values 
less than or equal to the number of cells in the input map layer. 
Percentage values given should be within the range 0.00 - 100.00 
(decimal values are allowed). 
<DT><B>raster_output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The new raster map layer to hold program output. This map will contain 
the sites randomly generated by <EM>r.random</B>.</EM> If the -z flag is not set, 
all sites will be assigned whatever category values were assigned these 
cell locations in the <EM>input</EM> raster map layer. 
If the -z flag is set, all sites except those falling on NULL cells
in the <EM>input</EM> value will be assigned the category values 
assigned these cells in the input layer; sites falling on NULL cells 
in the <EM>input</EM> layer will be assigned to a newly created 
category in the <EM>raster_output</EM> layer with at least one integer
value less than the minimum value in the <EM>input</EM> layer. 
<DT><B>vector_output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The new GRASS <EM>vector_output</EM> file to hold program output. 
If no <EM>vector_output</EM> file name is given on the command line, 
no <EM>vector_output</EM> file will be created by <EM>r.random</B>.</EM> 
(See <EM>raster_output</EM> parameter description, above.) 

Note. Although the user need not request that <EM>r.random</EM> output 
both a raster map layer (<EM>raster_output</EM>) 
and a vector points map (<EM>vector_output</EM>), the user must 
specify that at least one of these outputs be produced. 
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

To create random vector point locations within some, but not all, 
non-zero categories of the input raster map layer, 
the user must first create a reclassified raster map layer 
of the original raster map layer (e.g., using the GRASS 
program <EM><A HREF="r.reclass.html">r.reclass</A></EM>) 
that contains only the desired categories, 
and then use the reclassed raster map layer as input to <EM>r.random</B>.</EM> 

<H2>BUGS</H2>

It's not possible to use the <B>-i</B> flag and not also specify the <B>n</B> 
parameter.
