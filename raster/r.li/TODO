TODO list

A few remaining things should be done soon:
- add relevant references
- change AUTHORS as already indicated by you 
- add missing description.html (use e.g. r.li.dominance/description.html
  as template):
  - r.li.patchnumber
  - r.li.shape
- use english variable names as much as possible

Please change the examples to Spearfish wherever possible.
