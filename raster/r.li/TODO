TODO list

A few remaining things should be done soon:
- add relevant references
- change AUTHORS as indicated by you (offlist, see below)
- fix static local r.li.daemon library "libr_li.a" to dynamic
  (see raster/simwe/simlib/ how to do that)
- fix "clean" target in r.li.daemon (ipc binary and library)
- missing description.html:
  - r.li.patchnumber
  - r.li.shape

Then r.li can be activated to ../raster/Makefile.
