<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<EM>r.li.patchdensity</EM> is a patch index for r.li program.<br>
It calculates the function <br>
<I> f(sample_area)= (Patch_Number/Area) * 1000000 </I><br>
that is 1000000 by number of patch for area unit.
This index is calculated using a 4 neighbour algorithm<br>

<P><P>
Use at your own risk. This software comes with absolutely no warranty.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>
To calculate patch density index on map my_map, using 
~/.r.li/history/my_conf configuration file and saving results in
my_out file run:
<div class="code"> r.li.patchdensity map=my_map conf=my_conf out=my_out</div>
Note that you MUST NOT USE ABSOLUTE PATH NAMES for configuration or 
output files, because conf files are in ~/.r.li/history folder,
while output files are raster if moving window disposition was 
selected, otherwise they are in ~/.r.li/output folder.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
Do not use absolute path names for configuration file names. They are 
all in ~/.r.li/history folder.<br>

Do not use absolute path names for output files. They are raster 
if moving window disposition was selected, otherwise they are in 
~/.r.li/output folder.

An that is full of null values is considered to have zero patch. <br>
If you want to have null values instead run <br>
<div class="code"> r.null setnull=0 map=my_map</div><br>
after index calculation.
