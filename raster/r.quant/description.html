<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<em>r.quant</em> produces the quantization file for a floating-point map.
<P>

The <em>map</em> parameter defines the map for which the rules be to be
created. If more than one map is specified, then this implies that the
floating-point range is the miniumum and maximum of all the maps together,
unless either basemap=map or fprange=min,max is specified.

<H2> Quant rules </H2> 

The quant rules have to be entered interactively.
<p>
If rules is specified, the input has the form: <p>

              value1:value2:cat1:[cat2] <p>

where value1 and value2 are floating point values and cat1 cand cat2 are
integers. If cat2 is missing, it is taken to be equal to cat1. All values
can be "*" which means infinity.

<H2>NOTE</H2>
It is an error for both basemap and fprange to be specified.
