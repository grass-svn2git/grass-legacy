  fast version of r.watershed
  ===========================
  
  Implemented is a new sorting algorithm for both the ram and the 
  segmented version, resulting in significant speed improvements,
  with identical results.
  
  The following procedure assumes that GRASS was compiled from source
  and that the configured source tree is available.
  To compile and install the test version of r.watershed for GRASS,
  
  1) copy the directory <r.watershed2> into the directory 
     <raster> of the GRASS souorce tree
  
  2) edit <Makefile> in directory <raster>
     add the line
     r.watershed2 \
     e.g. after 
     r.watershed \
    
  3) change to directory <r.watershed2>
     run make
    
  4) optionally change to GRASS source directory, something like 
     grass-6.4.svn
     run as su
     make install
    
  Testing
  =======
  
  The new test version can be invoked with r.watershed2.
  The new sorting algorithm is implemented for both the ram and the
  segmented version.
  The new segmented version is still much slower than the new ram 
  version, but the new segmented version is already much faster than 
  the original ram version. A new option is available for the segmented 
  mode specifying the maximum amount of memory to be used in MB.
  Set up a watershed analysis with the original version, run it.
  The command will have been r.watershed <options>
  To test, use the same input options, but different output maps 
  and run r.watershed2 <test options>
  There should be no differences in the outputs of the original and 
  the new version.
