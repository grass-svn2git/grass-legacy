<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program outputs a two or four column (with -g) ASCII file (or stdout).
The default two column output consists of cumulative profile length in
meters and raster value. The optional four column output consists of an
easting, northing, cumlative profile length (m), and raster value.  Profile
end or "turning" points can be set manually with the <EM>profile</EM>
argument or selected interactively from the GRASS monitor by setting the
<EM>-i</EM> flag. The profile resolution, or distance between profile
points, is obatined from the current region resolution, or can be manually
set with the <EM>res</EM> argument.
<P>
The <B>-i</B> flag allows the user for selecting the profile from the GRASS
monitor by clicking the left mouse button along the profile, clicking the
right mouse button ends the profile.
<P>
The <B>profile</B> parameter can be set to comma separated geographic
coordinates for profile line endpoints The interactive flag (<EM>-i</EM>)
overrides this option.

The <B>res</B> parameter sets the distance between each profile point
(resolution). The resolution must be provided in GRASS database units (i.e.
decimal degrees for Lat Long database and meters for UTM). By default
<EM>r.profile</EM> uses the resolution of the current GRASS region,


<H2>OUTPUT FORMAT</H2>

The 2 or 4 column output from <EM>r.profile</EM> is intened for easy use in
other programs.  The output can be piped (|) directly into other programs or
saved to file for later use. The 4 column output is compatible with
<EM>v.in.ascii</EM> and can be piped direcly into this program for later
plotting.

<PRE>
r.profile -ig input=elev.rast output=- | v.in.ascii output=elev.profile
</PRE>

The 2 column output is compatible with most plotting programs.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The profile resolution is measured exactly from the supplied end or
"turning" point along the profile. The end of a profile segment will be an
exact multiple of the profile resolution and will therefore not always match
the end point coordinates entered for the segmanet.

<p>
To extract the numbers in scripts, following parameters can be used:
<pre>
           r.profile dgm12.5 prof=3570631,5763556 out=- 2>/dev/null
</pre>
This filters out the everything except the numbers.
