<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<em>r.walk</em> outputs a raster map layer showing the lowest
cumulative cost of moving between each cell and the user-specified
starting points. It uses an input elevation raster map layer whose
cell category values represent elevation, combined with a second input
raster map layer whose cell values represent friction costs.

This function is similar to <em>r.cost</em>, but in addiction to a
friction map, it considers an anisotropic directional cost due to the
different costs associated with downhill and uphill movements.
<p>


The formula from Aitken 1977/Langmuir 1984 (based on Naismith's rule
for walking times) has been used to estimate the cost parameters of
specific slope intervals:

<p>
T= [(a)*(Delta S)] + [(b)*(Delta H uphill)] + [(c)*(Delta H moderate downhill)] + [(d)*(Delta H steep downhill)] <br>
where:<br>
T is time of movement in seconds,<br>
Delta S is the distance covered in meters,<br>
Delta H is the altitude difference.
<p> 

The a, b, c, d parameters take in account movement speed in the different conditions and are linked to: 
<ul>
  <li>a: underfoot condition</li>
  <li>b: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement uphill</li>
  <li>c: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement moderate downhill</li>
  <li>d: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement steep downhill</li>
</ul>

It has been proved that moving downhill is favourable up to a specific
threshold slope value, after that it became unfavourable. This value
is defined in the source code and has been calibrated on man behaviour
(&gt;5 and &lt;12 degrees: moderate downhill; &gt;12 degrees: steep
downhill). The default values for a, b, c, d are those proposed by
Langmuir (0.72, 6, 1.9998, -1.9998), based on man walking effort in
standard conditions.<p>

For a more accurate result, the "knight's move" option can be used
(although it is more time consuming).In the diagram below, the center
location (O) represents a grid cell from which cumulative distances
are calculated. Those neighbours marked with an x are always
considered for cumulative cost updates. With the "knight's move"
option, the neighbours marked with a K are also considered.

<p>
Once <em>r.walk</em> computes the cumulative cost map as a linear
combination of friction cost (from friction map) and the altitude and
distance covered (from the digital elevation model), <em>r.drain</em>
can be used to find the minimum cost path.
