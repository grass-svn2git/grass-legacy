<h2>Raster data processing in GRASS GIS</h2>


<h3>Raster maps in general</h3>

The geographic boundaries of the raster file are described by the north,
south, east, and west fields. These values describe the lines which bound
the map at its edges. These lines do NOT pass through the center of the
grid cells at the edge of the map, but along the edge of the map itself.

<P>
As a general rule in GRASS:
<ol>
<li> Raster output maps have their bounds and resolution equal to those
of the current region.
<li> Raster input maps are automatically cropped/padded and rescaled
(using nearest-neighbour resampling) to match the current region.
</ol>

There are a few exceptions to this:

<tt>r.in.*</tt> programs read the data cell-for-cell, with no resampling. When
reading non-georeferenced data, the imported map will usually have its
lower-left corner at (0,0) in the location's coordinate system; ther user
needs to use <a href="r.region.html">r.region</a> to "place" the imported map.
<P>
Some programs which need to perform specific types of resampling (e.g. 
<a href="r.resamp.rst.html">r.resamp.rst</a>) read the input maps at their original resolution then do
the resampling themselves.
<P>
<a href="r.proj.html">r.proj</a> has to deal with two regions (source and destination)
simultaneously; both will have an impact upon the final result.


<h3>Raster import</h3>

The module <a href="r.in.gdal.html">r.in.gdal</a> offers a common
interface for many different raster formats. Additionally, it also
offers options such as on-the-fly location creation or extension of
the default region to match the extent of the imported raster map.
For special cases, other import modules are available. Always the full
map is imported.
<P>
For importing scanned maps, the user will need to create a
x,y-location, scan the map in the desired resolution and save it into
an appropriate raster format (e.g. tiff, jpeg, png, pbm) and then use
<a href="r.in.gdal.html">r.in.gdal</a> to import it. Based on
reference points the scanned map can be recified to obtain geocoded
data.

<h3>Raster map operations</h3>

GRASS raster map processing is always performed in the current region
settings (see <a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>), i.e. the current
region extent and current raster resolution is used. If the resolution
differs from that of the input raster map(s), on-the-fly resampling is
performed (nearest neighbor resampling). If this is not desired, the
input map(s) has/have to be resampled beforehand with one of the dedicated
modules.

<h3>Raster map interpolation methods</h3>

GRASS offers various 2D raster interpolation methods:

<ul>
<li> Inverse distance weighted average (IDW) interpolation</li>
<li> Regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation 2D</li>
<li> Bilinear interpolation</li>
<li> Cubic convolution interpolation</li>
<li> Resampling</li>
<li> Interpolating from contour lines</li>
</ul>
