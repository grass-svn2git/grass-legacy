[r.topmodel]
simulates TOPMODEL which is a physically based hydrologic model.


Parameters:
(i)	elevation:	Rectangular elevation map

(i)	basin:		Basin map created by r.water.outlet

(o)	depressionless:	Depressionless elevation map

			This can be omitted if [elevation] map is already
			a depressionless map.  If this is given,
			[depressionless] map will be used as [elevation] map.

(o)	direction:	This should be given with the [depressionless] map.

(o/i)	belevation:	Study basin extracted elevation map

(o/i)	topidx:		Study basin extracted topographic index map

(i)	nidxclass:	Number of topographic index classes

(o/i)	idxstats:	Topographic index statistics file

(i)	parameters:	TOPMODEL parameters file

(i)	input:		Rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data file

(o)	output:		Output file

	Qobs:		Compare Qt with Qobs and calculate the model efficiency

	timestep:	OPTIONAL output for the given time step

	idxclass:	OPTIONAL output for the given topographic index class


(i)   means input
(o)   means output
(o/i) means ouput or input with -i flag


Flags:
	-i:		Without this flag, all input data (i) and intermediate
			output (o/i) should be given and intermediate output can
			not be input for run.

			For example, [belevation] map will be created from 
			[elevation] and [basin] in every run.  However, every 
			[belevation] output is the same and this is useless
			process if [belevation] map is already given.

			With this flag, intermediate output can be input for
			run.  (o/i) parameters will be affected by the flag.

	-o:		Overwrite outputs
