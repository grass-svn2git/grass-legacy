<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.basins.fill</EM>
generates a raster map layer depicting subbasins, based 
on input raster map layers for the coded stream network 
(where each channel segment has been "coded" with a unique category value) 
and for the ridges within a given watershed. 
The raster map layer depicting ridges should include 
the ridge which defines the perimeter of the watershed. 
The coded stream network can be generated 
as part of the 
<EM><A HREF="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</A></EM> program, 
but the map layer of ridges will need to be created by hand, 
either through digitizing done in 
<EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>.

<P>

The resulting output raster map layer will 
code the subbasins with category values matching 
those of the channel segments passing through them. 
A user-supplied number of passes through the data is 
made in an attempt to fill in these subbasins. 
If the resulting map layer from this program appears to 
have holes within a subbasin, the program should be 
rerun with a higher number of passes. 

<P>

The user can run <EM>r.basins.fill</EM> either interactively or non-interactively. 
If the user simply types <B>r.basins.fill</B> without other arguments on 
the command line, the program will prompt the user for the needed 
parameters using the standard GRASS 
<EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></EM>
interface.

<P>

If the user wishes to run the program non-interactively, the following 
parameter values must be specified on the command line: 


<H2>NOTES</H2>

The current geographic region setting is ignored. 
Instead, the geographic region for the entire input stream's 
map layer is used.
