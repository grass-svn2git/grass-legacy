<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<em>r.carve</em> takes vector stream data, transforms it to raster, and
subtracts depth from the output DEM.

<P>
The program will take the vector stream data, transform them to
raster, and subtracts a defaultdepth+additionaldepth from the DEM. If
the given width is more than 1 cell it will carve the stream with the
given width. With -n option it should eliminate all flat cells within
the stream, so when and if the water gets into the stream it will
flow. Site option generates x,y,z for points which define the stream
with the z value of the bottom of the carved-in stream. These sites
can then be combined with contour sites to interpolate a new DEM with
better representation of valleys.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<em>r.carve</em> does not create a depressionless DEM because many
depressions are in flat areas and not in the streams.


<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m -p
r.carve rast=elevation.10m vect=streams out=carve_dem width=20 depth=5
</pre></div>

<H2>BUGS AND CAVEAT</H2>

The module does not operate yet in latitude-longitude locations.  It
has not been thoroughly tested so not all option may work properly -
but this was the intention.
