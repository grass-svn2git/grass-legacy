<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>
<EM>r.resamp.interp</EM> fills a grid cell (raster) matrix with interpolated values
generated from a set of input layer data points. A choice of three
interpolation methods is available; each uses the weighted values of a different
number of adjacent cells in the input map to determine the value of each
cell in the output map as follows:
<ul>
<li>nearest neighbour (1 cell)</li>
<li>bilinear (4 cells)</li>
<li>bicubic (16 cells)</li>
</ul>

This module is intended for reinterpolation of continuous data
to a different resolution rather than for interpolation from scattered data
(use the <EM>v.surf.*</EM> modules for that purpose).
</p>


<P>
Note that for bilinear and bicubic interpolation,
cells of the output raster that cannot be bounded by the appropriate number
of input cell centers are set to null. This could occur due to the input
cells being outside the current region, being NULL or MASKed.
</p>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>
For longitude-latitude databases, the interpolation algorithm is based on
degree fractions, not on the absolute distances between cell centers.  Any
attempt to implement the latter would violate the integrity of the
interpolation method.
