<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Locates the closest points between "objects" in two raster maps.  An
"object" is defined as all the grid cells that have the same category
number, and closest means having the shortest "straight-line" distance.

<P>

The output is an ascii list, one line per pair of objects
<PRE>
           cat1:cat2:distance:east1:north1:east2:north2
</PRE>

<H3>Explanation:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>cat1</B>
<DD>Category number from map1

<DT><B>cat2</B>
<DD>Category number from map2

<DT><B>distance</B>
<DD>The distance in meters between "cat1" and "cat2"

<DT><B>east1,north1</B>
<DD>The coordinates of the grid cell "cat1" which is closest to "cat2"

<DT><B>east2,north2</B>
<DD>The coordinates of the grid cell "cat2" which is closest to "cat1"
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>
The output format lends itself to filtering.  For example, to "see" lines
connecting each of the category pairs in two maps, filter the output using
awk and then into <EM>d.map</EM> graph:
<P>

<DD><EM>r.distance maps=map1,map2 | \
<DD>awk -F: '{print "move",$4,$5,"draw",$6,$7}' | d.mapgraph</EM>

<P>
To create a site list of all the "map1" coordinates, filter the output into
awk and then into <EM>s.in.ascii</EM>:
<P>

<DD><EM>r.distance maps=map1,map2 | \
<DD>awk -F: '{print $4,$5}' | s.in.ascii sites=name</EM>
