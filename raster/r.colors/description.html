<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>r.colors</i> allows the user to create and/or modify the color table for a
raster map layer. The map layer (specified on the command line by
<b>map=</b><i>name</i>) must exist in the user's current mapset search path.
The color table specified by <b>color=</b><i>type</i> must be one of the
following:

<pre>
     color type    description   
     aspect        (aspect oriented grey colors)   
     grey          (grey scale)
     grey.eq       (histogram-equalized grey scale)
     grey.log      (histogram logarithmic transformed grey scale)
     byg           (blue through yellow to green colors)
     byr           (blue through yellow to red colors)
     gyr           (green through yellow to red colors)
     rainbow       (rainbow color table)   
     ramp          (color ramp)   
     random        (random color table)   
     ryg           (red through yellow to green colors)
     wave          (color wave)   
     rules         (create new color table based on user-specified rules)
</pre>

<p>
Option <b>rast</b> allows user to specify a raster map <i>name</i> from which
to copy the color map.

<p>
Additionally there is a set of extra color tables (aspect, bcyr, byg, byr,
elevation, grey, gyr, rainbow, ramp, ryb, ryg, slope, terrain, wave) which are
stored in $GISBASE/etc/colors/.

<p>
The <b>-e</b> flag equalizes the original raster's color table. It can preclude
the need for <em>grey.eq</em> rule, when used as
<b>-e color=</b><em>grey</em>. Note however, that this will not yield a color
table identical to <em>color=grey.eq</em>, because <em>grey.eq</em> scales
the fraction by 256 to get a grey level, while <b>-e</b> uses it to interpolate
the original colour table. If the original colour table is a 0-255 grey scale,
<b>-e</b> is effectively scaling the fraction by 255. Different algorithms are
used. <b>-e</b> is designed to work with any color table, both the floating
point and the integer raster maps.

<p>
The <b>-g</b> flag divides the raster's grey value range into 100
logarithmically equal steps (where "step" is a rule with the same grey level
for the start and end points). It can preclude the need for <em>grey.log</em>
rule, when used as <b>-g color=</b><em>grey</em>. Note however, that this
will not yield a color table identical to <em>color=grey.log</em>. Different
algorithms are used. Unlike <b>color=</b><em>grey.log</em>, <b>-g</b> is
designed to work with both floating point and integer rasters, without
performance issues with large datasets, of any original color table. Logarithmic
scaling doesn't work on negative values. In the case when the value range
includes zero, there's no realistic solution.

<p>
<b>-e</b> and <b>-g</b> are not mutually exclusive.

<p>
If the user specifies the <b>-w</b> flag, the current color table file for
the input map will not be overwritten. This means that the color table is
created only if the <i>map</i> does not already have a color table. If this
option is not specified, the color table will be created if one does not
exist, or modified if it does.

<p>
If the user sets the <b>-q</b> flag, <i>r.colors</i> will run quietly,
Without printing numerous messages on its progress to standard output.
<p>Color table types <i>aspect, grey, grey.eq</i> (histogram-equalized grey
scale), <i>byg</i> (blue-yellow-green), <i>byr</i> (blue-yellow-red),
<i>gyr</i> (green-yellow-red), <i>rainbow, ramp, ryg</i> (red-yellow-green),
<i>random</i>, and <i>wave</i> are pre-defined color tables that
<i>r.colors</i> knows how to create without any further input.

<p>
In general, tables which associate colors with percentages (aspect, bcyr, byg,
byr, elevation, grey, gyr, rainbow, ramp, ryb, ryg and wave) can be applied to
any data, while those which use absolute values (aspectcolr, curvature, etopo2,
evi, ndvi, population, slope, srtm, and terrain) only make sense for data with
certain ranges.

One can get a rough idea of the applicability of a colour table by reading the
corresponding rules file ($GISBASE/etc/colors/<name>). E.g. rule <em>slope</em>
is defined as:

<p>0   255 255 255
<br>2   255 255   0
<br>5     0 255   0
<br>10    0 255 255
<br>15    0   0 255
<br>30  255   0 255
<br>50  255   0   0
<br>90    0   0   0

<p>
This is designed for the slope map generated by r.slope.aspect, where the value
is a slope angle between 0 and 90 degrees.

<p>
Similarly, the <em>aspectcolr</em> rule:

<p>0 white
<br>1 yellow
<br>90 green
<br>180 cyan
<br>270 red
<br>360 yellow

<p>
is designed for the aspect maps produced by r.slope.aspect, where the value is a
heading between 0 and 360 degrees.

<p>
The <i>rules</i> color table type will cause <i>r.colors</i> to read color
table specifications from standard input (stdin) and will build the color table
accordingly.

<p>
Using color table type <i>rules</i>, there are three ways to build a color
table: by color list, by category values, and by "percent" values.

<p>
Building a customized color table by color list is the simplest of the three
rules methods: just list the colors you wish to appear in the color table in the
order that you wish them to appear. Use the standard GRASS color names: white,
black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, aqua, grey, gray, orange, brown,
purple, violet, and indigo.

<p>
For example, to create a color table for the raster map layer <i>elevation</i>
that assigns greens to low map category values, browns to the next larger
map category values, and yellows to the still larger map category values,
one would type:

<p>
<b>r.colors map=</b><i>elevation</i> <b>color=</b><i>rules</i>
<br>green
<br>brown
<br>yellow
<br>end

<p>
To build a color table by category values' indices, the user should determine
the range of category values in the raster map layer with which the color table
will be used. Specific category values will then be associated with specific
colors. Note that a color does not have to be assigned for every valid category
value because <i>r.colors</i> will interpolate a color ramp to fill in where
color specification rules have been left out. The format of such a specification
is as follows:

<p>
<b>category_value color_name</b>
<br><b>category_value color_name</b>
<br><b>.. ..</b>
<br><b>.. ..</b>
<br><b>category_value color_name</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
Each category value must be valid for the raster map layer, category values must
be in ascending order and only use standard GRASS color names (see above).

<p>
Colors can also be specified by color numbers each in the range 0-255. The
format of a category value color table specification using color numbers instead
 of color names is as follows:
 
<p>
<b>category_value red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>category_value red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>.. .. .. ..</b>
<br><b>.. .. .. ..</b>
<br><b>category_value red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
Specifying a color table by "percent" values allows one to treat a color table
as if it were numbered from 0 to 100. The format of a "percent" value color
table specification is the same as for a category value color specification,
except that the category values are replaced by "percent" values, each from
0-100, in ascending order. The format is as follows:

<p>
<b>percent_value% color_name</b>
<br><b>percent_value% color_name</b>
<br><b>.. ..</b>
<br><b>.. ..</b>
<br><b>percent_value% color_name</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
Using "percent" value color table specification rules, colors can also
be specified by color numbers each in the range 0-255. The format of a
percent value color table specification using color numbers instead of
color names is as follows:

<p>
<b>percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>.. .. .. ..</b>
<br><b>.. .. .. ..</b>
<br><b>percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
Note that you can also mix these three methods of color table specification; for
example:

<p>
<b>0 black</b>
<br><b>10% yellow</b>
<br><b>78 blue</b>
<br><b>magenta</b>
<br><b>purple</b>
<br><b>brown</b>
<br><b>100% 0 255 230</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
To set the NULL (no data) color, use the "nv" parameter:
<p><b>0 black</b>
<br><b>10% yellow</b>
<br><b>nv white</b>
<br><b>end</b>


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>
<li>
The below example shows how you can specify colors for a three category map,
assigning red to category 1, green to category 2, and blue to category 3. Start
by using a text editor to create the following rules specification file (save it
with the name <i>rules.file</i>):
</li>

<br><b>1 red</b>
<br><b>2 green</b>
<br><b>3 blue</b>
<br><b>end</b>

<p>
The color table can then by assigned to map <i>threecats</i> by the following
GRASS command:

<div class="code"><pre>
cat rules.file | r.colors map=threecats color=rules
</pre></div>

<li>
To create a natural looking LUT for true map layer <i>elevation</i>, use the
following rules specification file. It will assign light green shades to the
lower elevations (first 20% of the LUT), and then darker greens (next 15%, and
next 20%) and light browns (next 20%) for middle elevations, and darker browns
(next 15%) for higher elevations, and finally yellow for the highest peaks (last
10% of LUT).
</li>

<br><b>0% 0 230 0</b>
<br><b>20% 0 160 0</b>
<br><b>35% 50 130 0</b>
<br><b>55% 120 100 30</b>
<br><b>75% 120 130 40</b>
<br><b>90% 170 160 50</b>
<br><b>100% 255 255 100</b>

</ol>
