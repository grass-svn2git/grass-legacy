<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
This numerical program calculates transient, confined and
unconfined groundwater flow in two dimensions based on  
raster maps and the current region resolution.
All starting- and boundary-conditions must be provided as 
raster maps.
<br>
<br>
This module calculates the piezometric head and optionally the 
filter velocity field, based on the hydraulic conductivity and the piezometric head. 
The vector components can be visualized with paraview if they are exported
with r.out.vtk.
<br>
<br>
The groundwater flow will always be calculated transient. 
If you want to calculate stady state, set the timestep 
to a large number (billions of seconds) or set the 
specific yield/ effective porosity raster maps to zero.


<H2>NOTES</H2>

The groundwater flow calculation is based on Darcy's law and a 
finite volume discretization. The groundwater flow partial 
differential equation has the following form:

<p>
(dh/dt)*S = (ht - b) * Kxx * (d^2h/dx^2) + (ht -b) * Kyy * (d^2h/dy^2) + q

<ul>
<li>h -- the piezometric head im meters [m]</li>
<li>ht -- the piezometric head of the water surface in a unconfined aquifer or the top of the confined aquifer im meters [m] </li>
<li>dt -- the time step for transient calculation in seconds [s]</li>
<li>S -- the specific yield or the effective porosity no dimension [.]</li>
<li>b -- the bottom surface of the aquifer meters [m]</li>
<li>Kxx -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in x direction in meter per second [m/s]</li>
<li>Kyy -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in y direction in meter per seconds [m/s]</li>
<li>q - inner source in meter per second [m/s]</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
Two different boundary conditions are implemented, 
the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. By default the calculation area is surrounded by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
The calculation and boundary status of single cells can be set with the status map, 
the following states are supportet:

<ul>
<li>0 == inactive - the cell with status 0 will not be calulated, active cells will have a no flow boundary to an inactive cell</li>
<li>1 == active - this cell is used for groundwater calculation, inner sources and reacharge can be defined for those cells</li>
<li>2 == Dirichlet - cells of this type will have a fixed piezometric head value which do not change over time </li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
The groundwater flow equation can be solved with several solvers.
Two iterative solvers with sparse and quadratic matrices support are implemented.
The conjugate gradients (cg) method and the biconjugate gradients-stabilized (bicgstab) method. 
Aditionally a direct Gauss solver and LU solver are available. Those direct solvers
only work with quadratic matrices, so be careful using them with large maps 
(maps of size 10.000 cells will need more than one gigabyte of ram).

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
Use this small script to create a working
groundwater flow area and data. Make sure you are not in a lat/lon projection.
