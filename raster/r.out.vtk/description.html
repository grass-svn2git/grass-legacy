<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Outputs <I>Raster</I> maps in <I>VTK-ASCII</I> format.  <I>Map's</I> are
valid Raster map's in the current mapset.  <I>output</I> is the name of
an VTK-ASCII file which will be written in the current working directory.
If <I>output</I> is not specified then <B>stdout</B> is used.  
The module is sensitive to region settings (set with g.region).
<br>
<br>
Special features are that elevation, scaling, point/celldata and RGB Data are supported.
<br>
<br>
If no elevation map is given, the user can set the hight of the map by one value. 
Pointdata or celldata are availible. Also scaling is supportet for this elevation value. 
<br>
<br>
The RGB input requires 3 raster maps: red, green, blue  - in this order. 
The maps must! have values between 0 and 255, if not you will get lots of warnings!
More than 1 RGB Dataset (3 maps) is not supported. For now, RGB is only supported if
you choose an input map too, that may be changed in the future.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
This filter generates: 
<ul>
<li><I>structured points</I> with <I>celldata</I> or <I>pointdata</I> if no elevationfile is given</li>

<li><I>structured grid</I> (not recommendet) with <I>pointdata</I> if a elevationfile is given</li>
<li><I>polydataset</I> with <I>pointdata</I> if an elevationfile is given (default)</li> 
</ul>
And puts this in a simple VTK-ASCII file. Nor XML or 
binary output are supported. It is possible to choose more then one raster map
to be written in the VTK-ASCII file. Each cell-/pointdata is named like the raster map it represents.
You can visualize this file with the 
<EM><A HREF="http://www.vtk.org">VTK Toolkit</A></EM>, 
<EM><A HREF="http://www.paraview.org">Paraview</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net">MayaVi</A></EM> which are based on VTK.
If you have a raster map with partly no data, use the threshold filter in paraview to 
visualize the valid data. Just filter all data which is greater/lesser than the 
choosen null value in the VTK-ASCII file.
<br>
If elevation map is choosen, a polygonal grid is created with <i>quads</i>, 
but the user can choose also <i>triangle strips</i> or <i>vertices</i>. 
These dataformats a documented at <EM><A HREF="http://www.vtk.org">VTK Toolkit</A></EM>.



<H3>Difference between point- and celldata</H3>
r.out.vtk can export G3D cells with different representations.
<ul>
   <li>
      <I>pointdata</I> -- the cells/values are represented by the center of the cell. 
      Instead of cells, points are created. Each point can hold different values, 
      but the user can only visualize one value at a time. These points can 
      be connected in different ways.
   </li>
   <li>
       <I>celldata</I> -- is only provided if no elevation map is given. 
       The cells are created with the same hight and width like in GRASS. Each cell 
       can hold different values, but the user can only visualize one value at a time. 
   </li>
</ul>
