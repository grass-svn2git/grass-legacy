<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.random.cells</EM> generates a random sets of cells that are at
least <VAR>distance</VAR> apart. The cells are numbered from 1 to the
numbers of cells generated. Random cells will not be generated in areas
masked off.

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<B>output </B> Output map: Random cells. Each random cell has a unique
non-zero cell value ranging from 1 to the number of cells generated. The
heuristic for this algorithm is to randomly pick cells until there are no
cells outside of the chosen cell's buffer of radius <B>distance</B>.
<P>

<B>distance</B> Input value(s) [default 0.0]: <B>distance</B> determines the
minimum distance the centers of the random cells will be apart.
<P>
<B>seed</B> Input value [default: random]: Specifies the random seed that
<EM>r.random.cells</EM> will use to generate the cells. If the random seed
is not given,<EM> r.random.cells</EM> will get a seed from the process ID
number.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The original purpose for this program was to generate independent random
samples of cells in a study area. The <B>distance</B> value is the amount of
spatial autocorrelation for the map being studied. The amount of spatial
autocorrelation can be determined by using <EM>r.2Dcorrelogram</EM> with
<EM>r.2Dto1D</EM>, or <EM>r.1Dcorrelogram</EM>. With <B>distance</B> set to
zero, the <B>output</B> map will number each non-masked cell from 1 to the
number of non-masked cells in the study region.
