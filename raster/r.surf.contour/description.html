<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.surf.contour</EM> creates a raster elevation map from a rasterized
contour map.  Elevation values are determined using procedures similar
to a manual methods.
To determine the elevation of a point on a contour map, an individual
might interpolate its value from those of the two nearest contour lines
(uphill and downhill).


<P>

<EM>r.surf.contour</EM> works in a similar way.  Initially, a vector map of
the contour lines is made with the elevation of each line as an attribute.
When the program <EM><A HREF="v.to.rast.html">v.to.rast</A></EM>
is run on the vector map, continuous "lines" of rasters containing the
contour line values will be the input for <EM>r.surf.contour</EM>. For each
cell in the input map, either the cell is a contour line cell (which is
given that value), or a flood fill is generated from that spot until the
fill comes to two unique values. So the <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> algorithm
<strong>linearly interpolates</strong> between contour lines. The flood fill
is not allowed to cross over
the rasterized contour lines, thus ensuring that an uphill and downhill
contour value will be the two values chosen.  <EM>r.surf.contour</EM>
interpolates from the uphill and downhill values by the true distance.


<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Name of an existing raster map that contains a set of 
initial category values (i.e., some cells contain known elevation
values (denoting contours) while the rest contain NULL values or zeros (0)).

<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Name to be assigned to new output raster map that represents
a smooth (e.g., elevation) surface generated from
the known category values in the input raster map layer.
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<EM>r.surf.contour</EM> works well under the following circumstances:
1) the contour lines extend to the the edge of the current region,
2) the program is run at the same resolution as that of the input map,
3) there are no disjointed contour lines,
and 4) no spot elevation data BETWEEN contour lines exist.  Spot elevations at
the tops of hills and the bottoms of depressions, on the other hand, improve
the output greatly.
Violating these constraints will cause non-intuitive anomalies to appear in
the output map.  Run <EM> <A HREF="r.slope.aspect.html">r.slope.aspect</A>
</EM> on <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> results to locate potential anomalies.


<P>
The running of <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> is very sensitive to the resolution of
rasterized vector map.  If multiple contour lines go through the same raster,
slight anomalies may occur.  The speed of <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> is dependent
on how far "apart" the contour lines are from each other (as measured in
raster cells).  Since a flood fill algorithm is used, the program's running
time will grow exponentially with the distance between contour lines.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<EM>r.surf.contour</EM> has not been fully updated for NULL support and still
considers a value of "<tt>0</tt>" to be NULL. Thus any contour lines at 0 
elevation (e.g. the coastline) will be ignored. In such cases converting any
0 values in the input map to -1 with <EM>r.mapcalc</EM> may be a suitable
work-around.
<P>
Currently <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> will only produce CELL (integer) map output.
If you would like a finer grade output map (i.e. floating point) it is
recommended to multiply the <b>input</b> map by 1000 (for example) using
<em>r.mapcalc</em>, then divide the resultant <EM>r.surf.contour</EM> 
<b>output</b> map by 1000.0, again with <EM>r.mapcalc</EM>.
<P>
Volunteers are sought to remedy both these issues.
