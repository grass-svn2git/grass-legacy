<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.texture</em> - Creates map raster with textural features for
user-specified raster map layer. The module calculates textural features 
based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135 
degrees for a <em>distance</em> (default = 1).
<p>
In general, several variables constitute texture: differences in grey level values,
coarseness as scale of grey level differences, presence or lack of directionality
and regular patterns.

<p>
<em>r.texture</em> reads a GRASS raster map as input and calculates textural 
features based on spatial
dependence matrices for north-south, east-west, northwest, and southwest
directions using a side by side neighborhood (i.e., a distance of 1). Be
sure to carefully set your resolution (using 
<a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>) before running this program, or else your
computer could run out of memory.  Also, make sure that your raster map has
no more than 255 categories.  The output consists into four images for each
textural feature, one for every direction.</p>
<p>
A commonly used texture model is based on the so-called grey level co-occurrence
matrix. This matrix is a two-dimensional histogram of grey levels
for a pair of pixels which are separated by a fixed spatial relationship. 
The matrix approximates the joint probability distribution of a pair of pixels.
Several texture measures are directly computed from the grey level co-occurrence
matrix. 
<p>
The following are brief explanations of texture measures:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Angular Second Moment (ASM, also called Uniformity):
 This is a measure of local homogeneity and the opposite of Entropy.
 High values of ASM occur when the pixels in the moving window are
 very similar.
 <br>
 Note: The square root of the ASM is sometimes used as a texture measure,
 and is called Energy.</li>

<li> Inverse Difference Moment (IDM, also called Homogeneity):
 This measure relates inversely to the contrast measure. It is a direct measure of the
 local homogeneity of a digital image. Low values are associated with low homogeneity
 and vice versa.</li>

<li> Contrast (Contr):
 This measure analyses the image contrast (locally gray-level variations) as
 the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring pixels (similarity). Typically high,
 when the scale of local texture is larger than the <em>distance</em>.</li>

<li> Correlation (Corr):
 This measure  analyses the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring
 pixels. Typically high, when the scale of local texture is larger than the
 <em>distance</em>.</li>

<li> Variance (Var): A measure of gray tone variance within the moving
  window (second-order moment about the mean)</li>

<li> Difference Variance (DV): ...</li>

<li> Sum Variance (SV): ... </li>

<li> Sum Average (SA): ...</li>

<li> Entropy (Entr):
 This measure analyses the randomness. It is high when the values of the moving
 window have similar values. It is low when the values are close to either 0 or 1 (i.e. when the
 pixels in the local window are uniform).</li>

<li> Difference Entropy (DE): ...</li>

<li> Sum Entropy (SE): ...</li>

<li> Information Measures of Correlation (MOC): ...</li>

<li> Maximal Correlation Coefficient (MCC): ...</li>
</ul>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
- The program can run incredibly slow for large raster maps.
<p>
- The method for finding the maximal correlation coefficient, which
    requires finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not
    always converge.
