<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.in.poly</EM> allows the creation of GRASS binary
raster maps from ASCII files in the current directory
containing polygon and linear features.

The <B>input</B> file is a Unix input file, in ascii format, containing the
polygon and linear features.  The format of this file is
described in the section <A HREF="#format.html"><B>INPUT
FORMAT</B></A> below.

<P>Number of rows to hold in memory is per default 512.  This
parameter allows users with less memory (or more) on their
system to control how much memory <EM>r.in.poly</EM> uses.


<A NAME="format.html">
<H2>INPUT FORMAT</H2></A>

The input format for the <B>input</B> file consists of
sections describing either polygonal areas or linear
features.  The basic format is:

<PRE>
A                      &lt;for polygonal areas&gt;
    easting northing
    .
    .
    .
=   cat# label
L                      &lt;for linear features&gt;
    easting northing
    .
    .
    .
=   cat# label
</PRE>

The <EM>A</EM> signals the beginning of a polygon. It must
appear in the first column.  The <EM>L</EM> signal the
beginning of a linear feature. It also must appear in the
first column. The coordinates of the vertices of the
polygon, or the coordinates defining the linear feature
follow and must have a space in the first column and at
least one space between the <EM>easting</EM> and the
<EM>northing.</EM> To give meaning to the features, the
<EM>=</EM> indicates that the feature currently being
processed has category value <EM>cat#</EM> (which must be
an integer) and a <EM>label</EM> (which may be more than
one word, or which may be omitted).

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

An area described by four points:

<pre>
  A
  591316.80   4926455.50
  591410.25   4926482.40
  591434.60   4926393.60
  591341.20   4926368.70
  = 42 stadium
</pre>
