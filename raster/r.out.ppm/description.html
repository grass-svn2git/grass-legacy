<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<b>r.out.ppm</b> converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image file
at the pixel resolution of the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION. 
To get the resolution and regions settings of the raster map, run:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;	g.region rast=[mapname]<p>

before running r.out.ppm.<p>

The PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage by default.
Using -G, you may force r.out.ppm to use 8bit greyscale instead.
The greyscale conversion uses the NTSC conversion:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Y = .30*Red + .59*Green + .11*Blue

<p>
One pixel is written for each cell value, so if ew_res and ns_res
differ, the aspect ratio of the resulting image will be off.


<H2>NOTE</H2>
A few ppm file comments are written - the name of the GRASS
raster file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly legal,
I've found one PD image utility that chokes on them, so if you need 
a commentless ppm file, use out=- &gt; outfile.ppm. (When sending 
output to stdout, no comments are written.)

<H2>TODO</H2>
Allow combination of 3 grass files to represent R, G, B components of ppm file?
