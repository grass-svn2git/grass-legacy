<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.los</EM> generates a raster map output in which the
cells that are visible from a user-specified observer
location are marked with integer values that represent the
vertical angle (in degrees) required to see those cells (viewshed).

<P>
The program can be run either non-interactively or interactively. 
To run <EM>r.los</EM> non-interactively, the user must specify at least 
an <B>input</B> file name, <B>output</B> file name, and the geographic 
<B>coordinate</B>s of the user's viewing location on the command line; 
any remaining parameters whose values are unspecified on the command line 
will be set to their default values (see below). 

<P>

The <B>patt_map</B> is the name of a binary (1/0) raster map layer in which
cells within the areas of interest are assigned the category value '1', and
all other cells are assigned the category value '0'. If this parameter is
omitted, the analysis will be performed for the whole area within a certain
distance of the viewing point inside the geographic region boundaries.

<BR>

Default: assign all cells that are within the
<B>max_dist</B> and within the user's current geographic
region boundaries a value of 1.
<P>
The <B>obs_elev=</B> parameter defines the height of the observer (in
meters) above the viewing point's elevation.
<BR>
Default: 1.75 (meters) 
<P>

The <B>max_dist=</B> parameter is the maximum distance (in meters) from the
viewing point inside of which the line of sight analysis will be performed.
The cells outside this distance range are assigned the category value '0'.

<BR>
Options: 0-99999 (stated in map units) 
<BR>
Default: 1000 

<H2>NOTES</H2>

For accurate results, the program must be run with the resolution of the 
geographic region set equal to the resolution of the data 
(see <EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>).

<P>

It is advisable to use a 'pattern layer' which identifies
the areas of interest in which the line of sight analysis
is required.  Such a measure will reduce the time taken by
the program to run.
