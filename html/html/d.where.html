<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.where</b></EM>  - Identifies the geographic coordinates associated with 
point locations in the active frame on the graphics monitor.

<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<B>d.where</B>

<B>d.where</B> [<B>-1dlw</B>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.where</EM> is an <EM>interactive</EM> program that
allows the user, using the pointing device (mouse), to
identify the geographic coordinates associated with point
locations within the current geographic region in the
active display frame on the graphics monitor.

<P>

Each mouse click
will output the easting and northing of the point
currently located beneath the mouse pointer.  A
mouse-button menu is presented so the user knows which
mouse buttons to use. The output is always printed to the
terminal screen; if the output is redirected into a file,
it will be written to the file as well.

<P>
Mouse buttons:

<pre>
     Left:   where am i
     Middle: draw to/from here
     Right:  quit this
</pre>

The left mouse button prints the coordinates at the selected point,
the middle mouse button allows to query two points (they are connected by a
line for convenience). By using the right mouse button the module is left.


<H3>Flags:</H3> 

<DL>d.where -[1dlw]

<DT><B>-1</B>
<DD>Only one mouse click is executed. 
<BR>
This option is provided for shell scripts and programs which want to 
obtain only one point from the user. The output is only written 
to stdout, unless redirected into a file. The geographic location and 
mouse button pressed are output. 
<DT><B>-d</B>
<DD>Output lat/long in decimal degree
<DT><B>-l</B></DT>
<DD>Output lat/long referenced to current ellipsoid</DD>
<DT><B>-w</B></DT>
<DD>Output lat/long referenced to WGS84 ellipsoid using datum
transformation parameters defined in current location if available</DD>
</DL>


<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program uses the current geographic region setting and active frame. 
It is not necessary, although useful, to have displayed a map in the current 
frame before running <EM>d.where</EM>. The <em>-d</em> flag allows to
optionally output latitude/longitude coordinates pair(s) in decimal degree
rather than DD:MM:SS format. The <em>-w</em> flag will only produce
meaningful output if a datum is defined for the current location. Otherwise
the output will be the same as with the <em>-l</em> flag (i.e. referenced to
the current ellipsoid).
