<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map</B>
<DD>Name of existing vector map to be displayed

<DT><B>color</B>
<DD>Color desired for drawing lines. May be specified as a standard
grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 80:198:255).
<DD>Default: white

<DT><B>catnum</B>
<DD>List of category numbers to restrict which lines are drawn.  Ignored
if the <EM>legend</EM> option is used.

<DT><B>legend</B>
<DD>Name of a legend file specifying what color to use for 
each category (see below). If "-" is specified, the legend
will be read from standard input.
<DD>Default: none
</DL>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Use <EM>d.vect.line</EM> to draw labelled lines from a vector map to the GRASS
display.  By default, <EM>d.vect.line</EM> will draw all labelled lines in the
vector map with white.  The lines drawn may be restricted via the <EM>catnum</EM>
argument or by using a <EM>legend</EM> file.

<P>

The <EM>color</EM> argument may be any of the standard named GRASS colors,
or and RGB (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the
form <EM>&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;</EM> where <EM>num</EM> is
between 0 and 255.

<P>
An optional list of category numbers may be used to restrict which lines are
drawn (option ignored if a <EM>legend</EM> option is given).

<P>
More control can be had by creating a <EM>legend</EM> file.  At the
time of this writing, GRASS does not have any management functions
for specifying how vectors should be drawn, so this file must be
created by "hand".  The easiest way to create such a file, is
to copy the category file for the vector map, and edit it to
contain color specifications.  The format of the <EM>legend</EM>
file is <EM>category red green blue</EM>,
with one entry per line.
If a category for a map is not included
in this file, it will not be drawn unless there is a special "default"
entry with a category of * (i.e. the asterisk character).  Note that this
is a change from GRASS 5.0.x which used -1 as the default code.  This allows
the use of negative numbers.

<DL>
<DT><B>Example Legend File</B>
<DD>
* 255 255 255<BR>
1  210 198 168<BR>
5  168 198 220<BR>
</DL>

<P>

In the above, all labelled lines will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255)
except those labelled as categories 1 or 5.  If the "default" entry
had been omitted, then only lines labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.

<P>
One may place comments on any line in the legend file by starting it
with a non-numeric character ('#' is a good choice).  Empty lines
are ignored.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>
It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module
will change when an infrastructure for managing vector drawing
styles is implemented.
