<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.out.mpeg</EM> is a tool for combining a series of GRASS raster files 
into a single MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Expert Group) format file.  MPEG-1 
is a "lossy" video compression format, so the quality of each resulting 
frame of the animation will be much diminished from the original raster 
image.  The resulting output file may then be viewed using your favorite 
mpeg-format viewing program.
MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 provide much better quality animations.
<P>
The user may define up to four "views", or sub-windows, to animate 
simultaneously.  e.g., View 1 could be rainfall, View 2 flooded areas, 
View 3 damage to bridges or levees, View 4 other economic damage, all 
animated as a time series. A black border 2 pixels wide is drawn around 
each view. There is an arbitrary limit of 400 files per view (400 
animation frames).  Temporary files are created in the conversion 
process, so lack of adequate tmp space could also limit the number of 
frames you are able to convert.
<!-- flag to keep these to feed into another more modern encoder? -->
<P>
The environment variable GMPEG_SIZE is checked for a value to use as the 
dimension, in pixels, of the longest dimension of the animation image.  
If GMPEG_SIZE is not set, the animation size defaults to the rows &amp; 
columns in the current GRASS region, scaling if necessary to a default 
minimum size of 200 and maximum of 500.  These size defaults are overridden 
when using the -c flag (see below).  The resolution of the current GRASS 
region is maintained, independent of image size.  Playback programs have 
to decode the compressed data "on-the-fly", therefore smaller dimensioned 
animations will provide higher frame rates and smoother animations.
<P>
UNIX - style wild cards may be used with the command line version in place 
of a raster file name, but wild cards must be quoted.
<P>
Example:
<DD><tt>r.out.mpeg view1="rain[1-9]","rain1[0-2]" view2="temp*"</tt></dd>
<P>
If the number of files differs for each view, the view with the fewest files 
will determine the number of frames in the animation.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>-q</B>
<DD>Quiet - suppress progress report.

<DT><B>-c</B>
<DD>Convert "on the fly", uses less disk space by using <EM>r.out.ppm</EM> 
with stdout option to convert frames as needed instead of converting all 
frames to ppm before encoding.  Only use when encoding a single view.  
Use of this option also overrides any size defaults, using the CURRENTLY 
DEFINED GRASS REGION for the output size. So be careful to set region to 
a reasonable size prior to encoding.
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>view1</B>
<DD>Raster file(s) for View1.

<DT><B>view2</B>
<DD>Raster file(s) for View2.

<DT><B>view3</B>
<DD>Raster file(s) for View3.

<DT><B>view4</B>
<DD>Raster file(s) for View4.

<DT><B>output</B>
<DD>Name for MPEG output file.
<DD>Default: gmovie.mpg

<DT><B>qual</B>
<DD>Quality factor (1-5).
<DD>Default: 3
</DL>

A quality value of <EM>qual=1</EM> will yield higher quality images, but 
with less compression (larger MPEG file size).  Compression ratios will 
vary depending on the number of frames in the animation, but an MPEG 
produced using <EM>qual=5</EM> will usually be about 60% the size of 
the MPEG produced using <EM>qual=1</EM>.

<H2>BUGS</H2>
MPEG images must be 16-pixel aligned for successful compression, so if 
the rows &amp; columns of the calculated image size (scaled, with borders 
added) are not evenly divisible by 16, a few rows/columns will be cut off 
the bottom &amp; right sides of the image. The MPEG format is optimized to 
recognize image MOTION, so abrupt changes from one frame to another will 
cause a "noisy" encoding.
