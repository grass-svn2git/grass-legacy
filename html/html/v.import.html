<EM>(SCS GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.import</B>

<BR>

<B>v.import help</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program performs all of the processes that are needed to convert
ASCII DLG files <!--, binary DLG files, ASCII SCS-GEF files, ASCII ARC Ungenerate
files, ASCII DXF files, --> and ASCII vector files into binary vector files.
It also creates support files, the dig_plus file and the dig_att file
(only created when importing DLG<!--, SCS-GEF, or ARC files-->). The dig_plus
file contains topological information obtained by analyzing the vector file.
The dig_att file contains attribute information 'stripped' from the DLG file.
<!-- or SCS-GEF text data. -->  This dig_att file is created for vector files
by the labeling function of the GRASS <EM>v.digit</EM> program. 
<BR>This command must be run interactively.

<P>

<B>IMPORT FILES</B>

<BR>

After entering the command  v.import, the user will be asked which type of
file to import and create support files for:
<PRE>
Imports to GRASS Vector Format and Creates Needed Support Files
   1  -   Ascii DLG file  to GRASS Vector Format
   2  -   Ascii VECTOR file  to GRASS Vector Format
   3  -   Binary VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format
<!--	2  -   Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	3  -   ASCII DIGIT file  to GRASS Vector Format
	4  -   Binary DIGIT file to GRASS Vector Format
	5  -   ASCII SCS-GEF file to GRASS Vector Format
	6  -   ASCII ARC/INFO file to GRASS Vector Format
	7  -   ASCII DXF file to GRASS Vector Format
	8  -   ASCII TIGER file to GRASS Vector Format -->
</PRE>
<DT> 
<!--
<DD>If numbers 1-3 or 5-8 are chosen, <EM>v.import</EM> will respond with the
current database units (in feet or meters), and ask if the new vector file
is in the correct units for the database location.  If the new vector file
is not in the correct units, <EM>v.import</EM> will not allow it to be placed
in the current database location.  For each database location, all data
layer should have the same units.  If, for some reason, a data layer
has different units than the rest of the data layers in the same database,
a new database location will have to be created for it. -->


<P>

<B>ASCII DLG File to GRASS Vector</B>

<BR>

Converts ASCII DLG files (such as those created in GRASS) to a vector file
and creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM> and <EM>dig_att</EM> support files.
The user is asked several questions:
<P>
<OL> 

<LI> The name of the DLG data file. 
<P>
NOTE: It should be available in the $LOCATION/dlg directory.
If the DLG data has an attribute flat file, it should also be in $LOCATION/dlg.
<P>
<LI>Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line information. 
<P>
NOTE: Some machine-processed DLG files do not make the distinction between
lines and area edges.  For example, in a roads map, where the desired
information is line data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be
processed as an area.  Because of this, the user is asked to choose
whether to give precedence to areas or lines.  If precedence is given to lines,
the user should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled areas in
the DLG file will be stored as line data.  Any unlabeled areas would therefore
be lost (this is only a concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
information will be retained).  If precedence is given to areas,
lines will be stored as boundaries to areas that are unlabeled.
<P> 
<LI>Determine if you want to snap nodes to other nodes within a threshold.
<P>
NOTE:  BE CAREFUL!!!  This threshold is calculated using the scale
of the original DLG or <EM>v.digit</EM> file.  If the threshold is too high,
excessive snapping may occur, destroying the file.  In general,
users seldom need to snap nodes.  If snapping of nodes is desired,
the user may want to run <EM>v.support</EM> separately.  <EM>v.support</EM>
allows the user to set the snapping threshold.
<P>
<LI>Does the DLG data contain GRASS category codes?
<P>
<DD>NOTE:  Most non-GRASS computer systems will not be able to provide
the necessary codes.  The flat attribute file serves this purpose.
If the answer to this question is NO:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Enter a SUBJECT MATTER file name. 
A subject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes to the DLG data.
It is structured the same as a <EM>dig_cats</EM> category file.  It is
suggested that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location and
a file containing all DLG attribute text labels by category be created.
This will be required to provide consistency across several maps (quads)
within one location.  The user may use the <EM>vi</EM> text editor or
the SCS macro <EM>make_subject</EM> to create it.
<P>
<LI> Enter an ATTRIBUTE file name.
<P>
This is the name of the flat file which will accompany a DLG from
a non-GRASS system.  This file contains all of the DLG area numbers
with a corresponding text label.
<P>
<LI>Is the DLG data from an ARC/INFO system. 
<P>
ARC/INFO DLG data is handled in a slightly different manner.
<P>
<LI>Does The DLG contain a Universe Polygon.
<P>
Some DLG files may or may NOT have this and processing will be required
to handle each case differently.
<DT> 

<DD>This process is done in three phases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>If the DLG does NOT contain category codes, then a category file
from the attribute file is created.  Then the ASCII dlg file is converted
to a binary <EM>dlg</EM> file.
<P>
- OR -
<P>
If the DLG does contain category codes, then the ASCII DLG file is
converted to a binary DLG file.
<P>
<LI>The binary <EM>dlg</EM> file is converted to a binary vector file,
and the <EM>dig_att</EM> support file containing attribute information is created.
<P>
<LI>The <EM>dig_plus</EM> support file is created by analyzing the vector
file for topological information.
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>
<!--
<B>Binary DLG File to GRASS Vector</B>
<BR>
Converts binary DLG files (which should be in the <EM>bdlg</EM> directory)
to a vector file and creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM> and <EM>dig_att</EM> support
files.  The user is asked whether precedence should be given to
Areas or Lines and if nodes should be snapped to other nodes
within a calculated threshold.
<P>
This process is done in two phases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The binary DLG (<EM>bdlg</EM>) file is converted to a binary vector file,
and the <EM>dig_att</EM> support file containing attribute information is created.
<P>
<LI>The <EM>dig_plus</EM> support file is created by analyzing the vector
file for topological information.
</OL>
<P> -->
<B>ASCII Vector File into GRASS Vector</B>
<BR>
Converts ASCII <EM>v.digit</EM> files (which are located in <EM>dig_ascii</EM>
directory) into binary vector files and creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM>
support file.  Since a vector file keeps the distinction between lines and
area edges, the user is not asked to give precedence to either.  However,
the user will be asked if the user wants to snap from nodes to other nodes
within a calculated threshold.
<P>
This process is done in two phases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The ASCII vector file is converted to a binary vector file, and the
<EM>dig_plus</EM> support file is created.
<P>
<LI>The <EM>dig_plus</EM> support file is created by analyzing the vector
file for topological information.
</OL>
<P>
<B>Binary Vector File to GRASS Vector</B>
<BR>
Creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM> support file.
<P>
This process is done in one phase: The <EM>dig_plus</EM> support file is created by analyzing
the vector file for topological information.
<P> <!--
<B>Acsii SCS-GEF File to GRASS Vector</B><BR>
Creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM>, <EM>dig_att</EM>, and <EM>dig_cats</EM> support files.
Creates a registration coordinates file.
Allows a user to create a GRASS vector file from a SCS-GEF format ASCII file.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The program will first request the name of the SCS-GEF file to be read in,
it expects to find the data in the $LOCATION/gef directory. 
<P>
<LI>The program will then request the name of a GRASS vector file.
<P>
<LI>The program will then request the name of a SUBJECT file.
A subject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes to the SCS-GEF
data.  It is structured the same as a <EM>dig_cats</EM> category file.
It is suggested that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location
and a file containing all SCS-GEF text labels by category be created.
This will be required to provide consistency across several mapsets
(quads) within one location.  The user may use the <EM>vi</EM> text editor
or the SCS macro <EM>make_subject</EM> to create it.
<P>
<LI>The program will then read the SCS-GEF header information,
interactively present information that was available,
and request additional data of the user.  These questions are :
<PRE>
           Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
           Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)
           Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)
           Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)
           Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)
           State FIPS code.
           County FIPS code.
           Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).
           Coord. System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).
</PRE>
<DD>The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data file and process it.
<P>
Note: scripts contains SCS macro <EM>make_1_gef</EM>.
This macro makes one file out of the three (3) files found in SCS-GEF
( see SCS-GEF technical specifications for more information).
The macro must be run on each data set BEFORE <EM>v.import</EM>.
</OL>
<P>
<B>ASCII ARC/INFO Ungenerate Format Files to GRASS Vector</B>
<BR>
Creates the <EM>dig_plus</EM>, <EM>dig_att</EM>, and <EM>dig_cats</EM> support files.
<BR>
The program will prompt you to enter the names of ARC/INFO files to
be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be imported into GRASS
must be exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO <EM>Ungenerate</EM> command.
ARC/INFO vector files which are to are to be imported to GRASS,
must be either line or polygon coverages.  They must also be placed
in a $LOCATION/arc directory.  The section of the ARC/INFO manual
that cover the <EM>Ungenerate</EM> command describes how to export line
and polygon coverages.  
<P>
A polygon coverage is represented by three files:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>a lines file, which contains coordiates of all the area edge lines;
<P>
<LI>label-point file, which contains coordintes of label-points each
with a unique label-point ID number.  There is one label-point
for each polygon defined in the lines file; and
<P>
<LI>a label-text file, which associates label-point ID number
with a category value and attribute text.
<P>
<DD>A line coverage is represented by two files: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>a lines file, which contains coordinates of of the lines,
each with a line-ID number; and
<P>
<LI>a label-text file, which associates each line-ID number with a
category value and attribute text.
</OL>
<P>
The program will start out by asking you which type of coverage
is to be imported, as follows:
<P>
<B>IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE</B>
<P>
The prompts that will be presented for coverage type "polygon."
<PRE>
             COVERAGE TYPE
             Enter "polygon" or "line"
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             &gt;
        Answer "polygon"


             NEATLINE
             Do you want a neatline ?
             Enter "yes" or "no"
             &gt; 
        If you answer yes then vectors representing 
	a box around the data will be inserted into
	the resulting GRASS vector file, otherwise 
	no neatline will be created.
</PRE>

Next the program will prompt for the name of the lines-file
containing the arc coodinates of the polygons.
The lines-file is created with the <EM>Ungenerate LINES</EM> option
and is the same format as the <EM>map_name.pol</EM> file
created by the program.  The following is the prompt: 
<PRE>
             LINES FILENAME
             Enter name of the file created with the LINES 
             option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             &gt;
</PRE>
The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the name
of the label-points file.  The label-points files is created with the
<EM>Ungenerate POINTS</EM> option and is the same format as the
<EM>mapname.lab</EM> file created by the <EM>export.vect</EM> ARC program.
The following is the prompt:
<PRE>
            LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
            Enter name of file created with the POINTS 
            option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command. 
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
            &gt;
</PRE>
The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the name of the
label-text file.  This file associates each label-point ID number
with a text string and is the same format as the <EM>mapname.txt</EM> file
created by the <EM>export.vect</EM> ARC program.  The following is the prompt: 
<PRE>
            LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
            Enter the name of a file that associates
            label-point ID numbers with text label strings
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file
            &gt; 
</PRE>
The program will then scan the label-text file to determine how
many columns are in the file and to determine which column
should be used as the label-point ID number column.  
<P>
The program will then tell you how many lines and columns
are in the label-text file.  Next you will be prompted to enter
the number of the column to be used for GRASS category values.
The category number column MUST contain only integers.
<PRE>
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used 
              for GRASS category values:
</PRE>

and the number the column to be used for GRASS attribute text.
The attribute text column can contain a floating point number,
an integer, or a word.
<PRE>
              Enter the number of the column that should be used 
              for GRASS attribute text: 
</PRE>
Once you enter the category and attribute column numbers, the program
will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO <EM>Ungenerate</EM> files
into GRASS vector format.

<P>

<B>IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE</B>
<P>
First, you are prompted for the name of the lines-file containing
the arc coordinates of the lines.  The lines-file is created with
the <EM>Ungenerate LINES</EM> option and is the same format as the
<EM>mapname.lin</EM> file created by the <EM>export.vect</EM> ARC program. 
<PRE>
              LINES FILENAME
              Enter name of the file created with the lines
              option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
              Hit RETURN to cancel request
              &gt;
</PRE>
The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the name of the
label-text file.  This file associates each line-ID number
with a text string and is the same format as the <EM>mapname.txt</EM> file
created by the <EM>export.vect</EM> ARC program.
<PRE>
              LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
              Enter name of file associating line ID numbers 
              numbers with label text. 
              Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
              &gt;
</PRE> 
The program will scan the label-text file to determine how many columns
are in the file and will then tell you how many columns are in the
label-text.  Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column
to be used for line-ID numbers. 
<PRE>
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for line-ID numbers:
</PRE>
Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column to be used
for GRASS category values.  The category number column MUST contain
only integers.
<PRE>
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for GRASS category values:
</PRE>
and the number of the column to be used for GRASS attribute text.
The attribute text column can contain a floating point number,
an integer, or a word.
<PRE>
              Enter the number of the column that should be used as
              for GRASS attribute text: 
</PRE>
Once you enter the column numbers the program will begin conversion
of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate files into GRASS vector format.

<P>

<B>DATA FILE FORMATS</B>
<P>
Following are examples of the data files discussed in the section above.

<DT> 

<DD>LINES FILE, also known as <EM>xxx.lin</EM> or <EM>xxx.pol</EM> file.
This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO by using the <EM>lines</EM>
subcommand of the <EM>Ungenerate</EM> command.
Each line, or arc, is defined by a line-ID number, followed by
a list of at least two easting and northing coordinate pairs,
followed by a line with the word "END".
The file is terminated with the word "END".

<BR>

The line-ID number is only important for line coverages.
For a line coverage, the line-ID number is the number that associates
each line with its attribute data.

<DD>NOTES
When importing a polygon coverage, the program finds the label-point ID
in a label-text file by looking for the second column in the file
that contains a "1" on line 1, and a "2" on line 2.

<BR>

If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file you can still import
ARC/INFO data (but none of your lines or areas will be labelled).

<B>ASCII TIGER Format Files to GRASS Vector</B>

<BR>

This program imports Census line features from TIGER records
type1 and type2 into GRASS vector format.  Both pre-Census and post-Census
data formats can be used.  Specific Census Feature Class Codes (CFCC)
can be extracted completely or in various combinations.  These codes
are described in the TIGER/line Census Files 1990 documemtation
available from the Bureau of the Census.  An additional feature code
consisting of the three letters "BOU" may also be specified to extract
a county boundary.  Condensed Record 1 files may be imported with
the -c flag.  These files should be identified with a trailing
"x" character on the filename.

<BR>

The TIGER files must in sorted order before being used.
This can be done by using the following command:
<PRE>
	sort TGR12113.F21 -o t12113.1 
	sort TGR12113.F22 -o t12113.2
</PRE>
For consistency the sorted file should be written as above.
It should consist of a 't' followed by the State and County FIPS code,
then a '.' and then a value to identify the record number. -->
