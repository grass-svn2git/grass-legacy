<H2>NOTES</H2>

If <B>output</B> is not specified it is set to be the same as input map name.
<BR>
If <B>dbase</B> is not specified it is assumed to be the current database.
<BR>
If <B>mapset</B> is not specified, its name is assumed to be the same as the
current  mapset's name. 
<BR>
<P>
The <B>-n</B> flag will disable the cropping of the input map to the 
vicinity of the current region before projection.
This will increase the processing time and memory usage of <EM>r.proj</EM>, 
but may be necessary in some situations, e.g. if you wish to project a polar 
region to a cylindrical projection.
The <B>output</B> map will still be cropped to the bounds of the current region.
<P>
<EM>r.proj</EM> supports general datum transformations, making use of the
<EM>PROJ.4</EM> co-ordinate system translation library.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2> 

<EM>r.proj</EM> projects a raster map in a specified mapset of a
specified location from the projection of the input location to a raster map
in the current location. The projection information is taken from the
momentary PROJ_INFO files.

<P><B>Introduction
<P></B><I>Map projections
<P></I>Map projections are a method of representing information from a
curved surface (usually a spheroid) in two dimensions, typically to allow
indexing through cartesian coordinates.  There are a wide variety of
projections, with common ones divided into a number of classes, including
cylindrical and pseudo-cylindrical, conic and pseudo-conic, and azimuthal
methods, each of which may be conformal, equal-area, or neither.  
<P>The particular projection chosen depends on the purpose of the project,
and the size, shape and location of the area of interest.  For example,
normal cylindrical projections are good for maps which are of greater extent
east-west than north-south and in equatorial regions, while conic
projections are better in mid-latitudes;  transverse cylindrical projections
are used for maps which are of greater extent north-south than east-west;
azimuthal projections are used for polar regions.  Oblique versions of any
of these may also be used.  Conformal projections preserve angular
relationships, and better preserve arc-length, while equal-area projections
are more appropriate for statistical studies and work in which the amount of
material is important.  
<P>Projections are defined by precise mathematical relations, so the method
of projecting coordinates from a geographic reference frame
(latitude-longitude) into a projected cartesian reference frame (eg metres)
is governed by these equations.  Inverse projections can also be achieved. 
The public-domain Unix software package <I>proj</I> [1] has been designed to
perform these transformations, and the user's manual contains a detailed
description of over 100 useful projections.  This also includes a
programmers library of the projection methods to support other software
development.  
<P>Thus, converting a &quot;vector&quot; map - in which objects are located
with arbitrary spatial precision - from one projection into another is
usually accomplished by a simple two-step process:  first the location of
all the points in the map are converted from the source through an inverse
projection into latitude-longitude, and then through a forward projection
into the target.  (Of course the procedure will be one-step if either the
source or target is in geographic coordinates.) <P>
Converting a &quot;raster map&quot;, or image, between different projections, 
however, involves additional considerations.  
A raster may be considered to represent a sampling of a
process at a regular, ordered set of locations.  The set of locations that
lie at the intersections of a cartesian grid in one projection will not, in
general, coincide with the sample points in another projection.  Thus, the
conversion of raster maps involves an interpolation step in which the values
of points at intermediate locations relative to the source grid are
estimated.  
<P>
<P><I>Projecting maps within the GRASS GIS</I><P>
GIS data capture, import and transfer often requires a projection
step, since the source or client will frequently be in a different
projection to the working projection.  
<P>In some cases it is convenient to do the conversion outside the package,
prior to import or after export, using software such as <I>proj</I> [1]. 
This is certainly the easiest method for <B>site-lists,</B> since there is
no topology to be preserved, and <I>proj</I> can be used to process simple
lists with a one-line command.  
<P>The format of files describing maps containing <B>lines</B><I> </I>and<I>
</I><B>arcs</B> is generally more complex, as even in ascii parts of the
files will describe topology, and not just locations.  In the GRASS GIS
package a program <I>v.proj</I> is provided to convert &quot;vector&quot;
maps, transferring topology and attributes as well as node locations.  This
program uses the projection definition and parameters which are stored in
the PROJ_INFO and PROJ_UNITS files in the PERMANENT mapset directory for
every GRASS location.  
<P>However, although it is oriented mainly towards operations on <B>raster
maps</B>, the standard GRASS distribution includes this <I>r.proj</I>
module to convert raster maps.  That is the purpose of the program
described here.
<P><B>Design of r.proj
<P></B>As discussed briefly above, the fundamental step in re-projecting a
raster is resampling the source grid at locations corresponding to the
intersections of a grid in the target projection.  The basic procedure for
accomplishing this, therefore, is as follows:
<p>
<EM>r.proj</EM> converts a map to a new geographic projection. It reads a
map from a different location, projects it and write it out
to the current location. 
<br>
The projected data is resampled with
one of three different methods: nearest neighbor, bilinear and
cubic convolution.
<p>
The nearest option, which performs a nearest neighbor assignment is the
fastest of the three resampling methods. It is primarily used for
categorical data such as a land use classification, since it will not change
the values of the data cells. The bilinear option determines the new value
of the cell based on a weighted distance average of the 4 surrounding cells
in the input map. The cubic option determines the new value of the cell
based on a weighted distance average of the 16 surrounding cells in the
input map.
<p>
The bilinear and cubic interpolation methods are most appropriate for
continuous data and cause some smoothing. Both options shouldn't be used
with categorical data, since the cell values will be altered.

If nearest neighbor assignment is used, the output map has the same raster
format as the input map. If any of the both interpolations is used, the
output map is written as floating point.

<P>Note that, following normal GRASS conventions, the coverage and
resolution of the resulting grid is set by the current region settings,
which may be adjusted using <I>g.region</I>.  The target raster will be
relatively unbiased for all cases if its grid has a similar resolution to
the source, so that the resampling/interpolation step is only a local
operation.  If the resolution is changed significantly, then the behaviour
of the generalisation or refinement will depend on the model of the process
being represented.  This will be very different for categorical versus
numerical data.  Note that three methods for the local interpolation step
are provided.
