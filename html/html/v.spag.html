<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.spag</b></EM>  - Process spaghetti-digitized binary vector file.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.spag</B>

<BR>

<B>v.spag help</B>

<BR>

<B>v.spag</B> [<B>-isp</B>] <B>map=</B><EM>name</EM> [<B>threshold=</B><EM>value</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program will fix vector data that were not digitized
in correct GRASS vector format.  It will create a node at
every line crossing, and will delete all hanging lines of
length less than the specified threshold.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>


<H3>Flag:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-i</B> 
<DD>Only do identical line removal pass.

<DT><B>-s</B>
<DD>Snap nodes.

<DT><B>-p</B>
<DD>Prompt user for threshold value. 

</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Name of the binary vector file to be fixed.

<DT><B>threshold=</B><EM>value</EM> 

<DD>Node-snapping threshold value.
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The user must run 

<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> 

after running <EM>v.spag</EM> to correct
the topology (<EM>dig_plus</EM>) file.


<P>

<EM>v.spag</EM> generally deletes many lines from the input
vector map layer.  Because deleted lines are not eliminated
from a vector data (<EM>dig</EM>) file, but are only marked
as deleted, the user will probably wish to run

<EM><A HREF="v.clean.html">v.clean</A></EM>


on the vector file after running <EM>v.spag</EM> to
eliminate any deleted lines from the <EM>dig</EM> file and
decrease its size.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

This program contains several known bugs.  It will
sometimes get stuck in a loop in which it creates the same
line over and over again.  It will occasionally create an
incorrect line.  Users are strongly urged to back-up their
vector data files before running this alpha version of
<EM>v.spag</EM>.


<P>

Update Note:<BR>
1/93:  For GRASS Release 4.1, the
<B>-i</B> flag has been added and bugs fixed.  It works better than the 
4.0 release.<BR>
6/00:  The <B>-s</B> and <B>-p</B> flags has been added. 
One reason for loop fixed, please report if you get into the loop after this date.
