DESCRIPTION</h2>
<i>v.surf.rst</i>
<br>This program interpolates the z-values from vector data (e.g., contours,
isolines) given in a vector file named <i>input</i> to grid cells in the
output raster file <i>elev</i> representing a surface. As an option, simultaneously
with interpolation, topographic parameters slope, aspect, profile curvature
(measured in the direction of steepest slope), tangential curvature (measured
in the direction of a tangent to contour line) or mean curvature are computed
and saved as raster files specified by the options <i>slope, aspect, pcurv,
tcurv, mcurv</i> respectively. If <b><i>-d</i></b> flag is set the program
outputs partial derivatives f<sub>x</sub>,f<sub>y</sub>,f<sub>xx</sub>,f<sub>yy</sub>,f<sub>xy</sub>
instead of slope, aspect, profile, tangential and mean curvatures respectively.
If the input data have time stamp, the program creates time stamp for all
output files.
<p>User can define a raster file named <i>maskmap</i>, which will be used
as a mask. The interpolation is skipped for cells which have zero or NULL
value in mask. NULL values will be assigned to these cells in all output
raster files. Data points are checked for identical points and points that
are closer to each other than the given <i>dmin</i> are removed. Additional
points are used for interpolation between each 2 points on a line if the
distance between them is greater than specified <i>dmax</i>. Parameter
<i>zmult</i>
allows user to rescale the z-values (useful e.g. for transformation of
elevations given in feet to meters, so that the proper values of slopes
and curvatures can be computed).
</p><p>Regularized spline with tension is used for the interpolation. The <i>tension</i>
parameter tunes the character of the resulting surface from thin plate
to membrane. For noisy data, it is possible to define a smoothing parameter
<i>smooth.
</i>With the smoothing parameter set to zero (<i>smooth=0</i>) the resulting
surface passes exactly through the data points. When smoothing parameter
is used, it is possible to output site file <i>devi</i> containing deviations
of the resulting surface from the given data.
</p><p>If the number of given points is greater than <i>segmax</i>, segmented
processing is used . The region is split into rectangular segments, each
having less than
<i>segmax</i> points and interpolation is performed on
each segment of the region. To ensure the smooth connection of segments
the interpolation function for each segment is computed using the points
in given segment and the points in its neighborhood which are in the rectangular
window surrounding the given segment. The number of points taken for interpolation
is controlled by <i>npmin</i>, the value of which must be larger than <i>segmax</i>
. User can choose to output vector files <i>treefile</i> and <i>overfile</i>
which represent the quad tree used for segmentation and overlapping neighborhoods
from which additional points for interpolation on each segment were taken.

</p><h2>
OPTIONS</h2>
The user can run this program either interactively or non-interactively.
The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies program
arguments and flag settings on the command line using the form:
<p><b>v.surf.rst [-d] [-r] [-c] [-t] input </b>= name <b>elev </b>= name
[<b> slope </b>= name] [<b> aspect </b>= name] [<b> pcurv </b>= name] [<b>
tcurv </b>= name] [<b> mcurv </b>= name] [<b> maskmap</b> = name] [<b>
dmin </b>= val] [<b> dmax </b>= val] [<b> zmult = </b>val] [<b> tension

</p><h2>
NOTES</h2>
<i>v.surf.rst </i>uses regularized spline with tensionfor interpolation
from vector data. Additional points are used for interpolation between
each 2 points on a line if the distance between them is greater than specified
<i>dmax</i>. If <i>dmax</i> is small (less than cell size) the number of
added data points can be vary large and slow down interpolation significantly.
The implementation has a segmentation procedure based on quadtrees which
enhances the efficiency for large data sets.Special color tables are created
by the program for output raster files.
<p>Topographic parameters are computed directly from the interpolation
function so that the important relationships between these parameters are
preserved. The equations for computation of these parameters and their
interpretation is described in
(<a href="http://skagit.meas.ncsu.edu/~helena/gmslab/papers/hmg.rev1.ps">Mitasova and Hofierka 1993</a>).
Slopes and aspect are computed in degrees (0-90 and 1-360 respectively).
The aspect raster file has value 0 assigned to flat areas (with slope less
than 0.1%) and to singular points with undefined aspect. Aspect points
downslope and is 90 to the North, 180 to the West, 270 to the South and
360 to the East, the values increase counterclockwise. Curvatures are positive
for convex and negative for concave areas. Singular points with undefined
curvatures have assigned zero values.
</p><p><i>Tension</i> and <i>smooth</i>ing allow user to tune the surface character.
For most landscape scale applications the default should work fine.The
program gives warning when significant overshoots appear in the resulting
surface and higher tension or smoothing should be used.
<br>While it is possible to automatize the selection of suitable <i>tension</i>
and <i>smooth</i>ing, it has not been done yet, so here are some hints
which may help to choose the proper parameters if the results look "weird".
It is useful to know that the method is scale dependent and the <i>tension</i>
works as a rescaling parameter (high <i>tension</i> "increases the distances
between the points" and reduces the range of impact of each point, low<i>
tension</i> "decreases the distance" and the points influence each other
over longer range). Surface with&nbsp; <i>tension</i> set too high behaves
like a membrane (rubber sheet stretched over the data points) with peak
or pit ("crater") in each given point and everywhere else the surface goes
rapidly to trend. If digitized contours are used as input data, high tension
can cause artificial waves along contours. Lower tension and higher smoothing
is suggested for such a case.
<br>Surface with <i>tension</i> set too low behaves like a stiff steel
plate and overshoots can appear in areas with rapid change of gradient
and segmentation can be visible. Increase tension should solve the problems.
<br>There are two options how <i>tension</i> can be applied in relation
to <i>dnorm</i> (dnorm rescales the coordinates depending on the average
data density so that the size of segments with <i>segmax=</i>40 points
is around 1 - this ensures the numerical stability of the computation):
</p><p>1. Default (used also in s.surf.rst): the given <i>tension</i>&nbsp;
is applied to normalized data (x/<i>dnorm</i>..),&nbsp; that means that
the distances are multiplied (rescaled) by <i>tension/dnorm</i>. If density
of points is changed, e.g.,&nbsp; by using higher <i>dmin</i>, the <i>dnorm</i>
changes and <i>tension</i> needs to be changed too to get the same result.
Because the <i>tension</i> is applied to normalized data its suitable value
is usually within the 10-100 range and does not depend on the actual scale
(distances) of the original data (which can be km for regional applications
or cm for field experiments).
<br>2. Flag<b> -t </b>(experimental for s.surf.rst)<b>: </b>The given <i>tension</i>
is applied to un-normalized data (rescaled tension = t<i>ension*dnorm</i>/1000
is applied to normalized data (x/<i>dnorm</i>) and therefore&nbsp; <i>dnorm</i>
cancels out) so here <i>tension</i> truly works as a rescaling parameter.
For regional applications with distances between points in km. the suitable
tension can be 500 or higher, for detailed field scale analysis it can
be 0.1. To help select how much the data need to be rescaled the program
writes
<i>dnorm</i> and rescaled tension=<i>tension*dnorm</i>/1000 at the
beginning of the program run. This rescaled <i>tension</i> should be around
20-30.&nbsp; If it is lower or higher, the given <i>tension</i> parameter
should be changed accordingly.
</p><p>The default is a recommended choice, however for the applications where
the user needs to change density of data and preserve the interpolation
character the <b>-t</b> flag can be helpful.</p>

2 times longer in the direction of <i>theta</i> than in the perpendicular direction.
<i>Scalex</i> value 2</font><font color="#000000"> means that axes ratio is reverse and you will get pattern 
perpendicular to the previous example. </font>Please note that anisotropy
option has not been extensively tested and may include bugs - if there are
problems, please report to GRASS bugtracker (accessible from http://grass.itc.it/).<br>

</p>
<p>The program gives warning when significant overshoots appear and higher
tension should be used. However, with tension too high the resulting surface
changes its behavior to membrane (rubber sheet stretched over the data
points resulting in a peak or pit in each given point and everywhere else
the surface goes rapidly to trend). Also smoothing can be used to reduce
the overshoots.
</p><p>For data with values changing over several magnitudes (sometimes the
concentration or density data) it is suggested to interpolate the log of
the values rather than the original ones.
</p><p>The program checks the numerical stability of the algorithm by computating
the values in given points, and prints the root mean square deviation (rms)
found into the history file of raster map <i>elev</i>. For computation
with smoothing set to 0. rms should be 0. Significant increase in <i>tension</i>
is suggested if the rms is unexpectedly high for this case. With smoothing
parameter greater than zero the surface will not pass exactly through the
data points and the higher the parameter the closer the surface will be
to the trend. The rms then represents a measure of smoothing effect on
data. More detailed analysis of smoothing effects can be performed using
the output deviations option.
</p><p>The program writes the values of parameters used in computation into
the comment part of history file <i>elev</i> as well as the following values
which help to evaluate the results and choose the suitable parameters:
minimum and maximum z values in the data file (zmin_data, zmax_data) and
in the interpolated raster map (zmin_int, zmax_int), rescaling parameter
used for normalization (dnorm), which influences the tension.
</p><p>If visible connection of segments appears, the program should be rerun
with higher <i>npmin</i> to get more points from the neighborhood of given
segment and/or with higher tension.
</p><p>When the number of points in a site file is not too large (less than
800), the user can skip segmentation by setting <i>segmax </i>to the number
of data points or <i>segmax=700</i>.
</p><p>The program gives warning when user wants to interpolate outside the
rectangle given by minimum and maximum coordinates in the vector file,
zoom into the area where the given data are is suggested in this case.
</p><p>When a mask is used, the program takes all points in the given region
for interpolation, including those in the area which is masked out, to
ensure proper interpolation along the border of the mask. It therefore
does not mask out the data points, if this is desirable, it must be done
outside <i>v.surf.rst.</i>
</p><p>For examples of applications see
<a href="http://skagit.meas.ncsu.edu/~helena/gmslab/">http://skagit.meas.ncsu.edu/~helena/gmslab/.</a>
</p><p>The user must run <a href="g.region.html">g.region</a> before the program
to set the region and resolution for interpolation.
