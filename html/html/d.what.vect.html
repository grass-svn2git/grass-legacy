<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.what.vect</b></EM> - Allows the user to interactively query the category 
contents of a (binary) vector map layer at user-selected locations 
within the current geographic region. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.what.vect</B> 
<BR>
<B>d.what.vect help</B> 
<BR>
<B>d.what.vect</B> [<B>-1td</B>] <B>map=</B><EM>name</EM> 
[<B>table=</B><EM>name</EM>] [<B>key=</B><EM>name</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.what.vect</EM>
outputs the category value(s) associated with user-specified location(s) 
in a user-specified vector map layer. This program currently returns 
only category values for line types in the user-specified vector file. 

<P>

The program will query the contents of the vector map layer named by the 
user on the command line. This map layer must exist in the user's current 
mapset search path. 

<P>

The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to indicate the 
location(s) to be queried by depressing a mouse button over desired location(s) 
within the current geographic region in the 
active display frame on the graphic monitor. 

<P>

Alternatively user can specify <B>table=</B> and <B>key=</B> and 
window with database attributes will be opened for each selected object
with assigned category.

<H3>Flag:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>-1</B>
<DD>Identify and query just one point location. Only one mouse click 
is executed. This option is provided for shell scripts and programs 
that want to obtain only one point from the user. 
<DT><B>-t</B>
<DD>Provide only terse output. This option is provided to simplify the 
parsing of output by other programs. Database connection must be set up
by <A HREF="db.connect.html">db.connect</A> first. 
<DT><B>-d</B></DT>
<DD>Disable flashing of vectors. Normally vectors flash when clicked on.
This can be a useful graphical aid, but can severely degrade performance
on a slow computer or over a network. This option allows the program
to run at normal speed.</DD>
</DL>


<H3>Parameter:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>map=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of an existing binary vector map in the user's mapset search path. 

<DT><B>table=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of database table containing attributes. 

<DT><B>key=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of database table key (id) column. 

</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

A sample <EM>d.what.vect</EM> session is given below. Although it is not 
necessary that the user first display a vector map to be queried in the 
active display frame, it is helpful to have a map displayed there for 
reference. 
<P>
<DT>
<DD><B><A HREF="d.vect.html">d.vect</A> map=</B><EM>roads.24000</EM>
<DD> Displays the 1:24,000 scale <EM>roads</EM> vector 
map layer on the graphics monitor. 
<P>
<DD><B>d.what.vect map=</B><EM>roads.24000</EM>
<DD>
After typing this, the user moves the mouse to a desired location 
on the displayed <EM>roads</EM> map layer, 
and presses the left mouse button to query the category value of the 
<EM>roads</EM> vector map at this location. The program then 
outputs the category value of a line type corresponding to this 
user-selected map location, for the vector map queried by the user. 

</DT>
<P>
The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left mouse button. 
The right button on the mouse is used to quit the <EM>d.what.vect</EM> session. 

<P>

Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts
that require as input a map category value and a mouse
button depressed.  Users can set the -1 flag to run
<EM>d.what.vect</EM> only once, and return only the map
category value found and the number of the mouse button
depressed. (Mouse button return values are as follows: 0
indicates no button was pressed, 1 indicates that the left
mouse button was pressed, 2 indicates the middle button was
pressed, and 3 indicates that the right mouse button was
pressed.)

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Currently, <EM>d.what.vect</EM> only outputs category values for lines. 
It does not output category labels for lines, nor output 
category values or category labels for areas in a vector file. 

<P>

<EM>d.what.vect</EM>
will always print its output to the user's terminal screen. 
<EM>d.what.vect</EM> output can be redirected into a file; 
however, if it is, the output will go both to the screen and to the file. 
For example: 
<DL>
<DD>
<B>d.what.vect map=</B><EM>roads</EM><B> &gt; what.out</B> 
</DL>

will both send <EM>d.what.vect</EM> output to the screen
and capture its output in the file named <EM>what.out</EM>.

<P>

<EM><A HREF="d.what.rast.html">d.what.rast</A></EM> 
can be used to interactively query the map category contents 
of multiple raster map layers at user-selected locations.
