<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program has been used to import vector files that were
in scanner or digitizer (x,y) coordinates and to transform
these into UTM coordinates.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Flag:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>-y</B>
<DD>Suppress the printing of residuals or other information 
to standard output. 
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of the binary vector map layer to be transformed. 
<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name to be assigned to the resultant (transformed) binary vector map layer. 
<DT><B>pointsfile=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of a file containing transformation points, 
whose format is given below. 
Give a full path name for this file or it will be assumed to 
be located in the user's current directory. 
</DL>

The user can run this program non-interactively by
specifying parameter values (and optionally, the flag
setting) on the command line.

<P>

If the user runs <B>v.transform</B> without specifying
program arguments on the command line, the program will
prompt the user for inputs.  When the program prompts the
user for two sets of transformation points, the first set
of points entered by the user should be in the coordinate
system of the input map, and the second set of points
should represent the corresponding geographic points in the
coordinate system into which the map will transformed.  A
user must enter 4 to 10 of each set of points for the
transformation to work correctly.

<P>

After the user has entered both sets of points, the program
will show the amount of error associated with the
transformation of the given points as the <EM>residual mean
average</EM> (RMS).  (An acceptable RMS for a 1:24,000 UTM
map would be 1.2 to 2.4 (meters).) It will then ask if the
transformation RMS value is acceptable.  After an RMS is
accepted by the user, <EM>v.transform</EM> will transform
the binary vector (<EM>dig</EM>) map and its
associated attribute (<EM>dig_att</EM>) file into the
requested coordinate system.

<P>

Remember to run 

<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> 

on the output map. 

<H2>NOTES</H2>

When rectifying a map to another coordinate system using
<EM>v.transform</EM>, the user should specify the
coordinates of between 4 to 10 points, and state these both
in the coordinate systems of the input and output maps.
The two sets of coordinates can be input to
<EM>v.transform</EM> interactively, or from a file
specified on the command line with the <EM>pointsfile</EM>
option.  The <EM>pointsfile</EM> option is especially
useful when several maps in the same geographic area
require transformation, as it eliminates the necessity for
the user to repeatedly type in the same transformation
coordinates.

<P>

A <EM>pointsfile</EM> file will contain between 4 to 10
lines; each line will contain the set of coordinate
transformation points for the input map and the
corresponding set of coordinates for the output map. The
minimum number of lines for the transformation to take
place is four.

<P>

The format of the <EM>pointsfile</EM> file is shown below: 

<PRE>
 Input Map   Output Map

 x       y   x        y
 x       y   x        y
 x       y   x        y
 x       y   x        y
</PRE>

In the format shown above the <EM>x</EM>'s and <EM>y</EM>'s
can be thought of as eastings and northings, depending on
what coordinate systems you are transforming to and from.

<P>

An example of the <EM>pointsfile</EM> file: 

<PRE>
 1       1       589000   4913000
 1       17000   589000   4930000
 17000   17000   610000   4930000
 17000   1       610000   4913000
</PRE>

Within the <EM>pointsfile</EM> file, numbers on a line must
be spaced apart with tabs or blanks.  The example shown
above was used to convert a map in digitizer coordinates
(range of 1-18000) to UTM coordinates within the UTM zone
for the Spearfish sample data base location.

<P>

Because this <EM>pointsfile</EM> file is not your usual
GRASS data file, the user will have to keep track of where
it is on the system.  When the <EM>pointsfile</EM> option
is used on the command line to input the transformation
points, the program does not ask whether or not everything
is acceptable before converting the vector file and the
attribute file.

<P>

The user is advised to run this program interactively with
a specific set of transformation coordinates and to examine
the resulting residuals, to determine how accurate the
transformation will be (i.e., pick points with known values
in both coordinate systems).  After the residuals are
acceptable, those transformation coordinates can be used
with the program run non-interactively to transform other
maps in the same geographic area.

<H2>WARNING</H2>

This is a general purpose program and can be fooled into
giving low residuals. It is strongly suggested that any
transformed map be checked for accuracy.  The program
assumes that the coordinate systems will be planimetric and
has never been tested with negative values.

<P>

It is not recommended to use this program to transform maps 
from State Plane to UTM coordinates (or between any two different
projections). Using
<A HREF="v.proj.html">v.proj</A> will give better results.
