<H2>NAME</H2>
<I>r.flowmd </I> - construction of slope lines (flowlines),  flowpath lengths 
and flowline  densities from  a raster digital elevation model using a 
modified multiple directions  algorithm. <P>

<B>r.flowmd </B> [<B>-d </B>] <B>elevin=name </B> <B>aspin=name

<P>
  
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<I>r.flowmd </I> <P>
  <BR> generates flowlines using a combined raster-vector approach from
input elevation <I>elevin </I>, aspect <I>aspin </I> and optionally barrier
<I>barrierin </I> raster maps.

<P> Input elevation raster map with integer values should have values in
centimeters preventing premature flowline stop in flat areas.  Aspect used
for input must follow the same rules as aspect computed in other GRASS
programs (see r.slope.aspect, s.surf.rst). Barriers are defined by non-zero
values in an input raster map <I>barierin </I>. Make sure that the
resolution of your current region is set to the resolution of the elevation
raster file.

<P> There are three possible output maps which can be produced in any
combination simultaneously: a vector file <I>flout </I> of flowlines, a
raster map <I>lgout </I> of flowpath lengths, and a raster map <I>dsout </I>
of flowline densities. Flowlines are constructed by straight line segments
(vectors) with endpoints creating intersections of the flowline with edges
of the imaginary mesh connecting centers of the grid cells.
 Flowlines are generated from each  cell uphill by default; they can be
generated downhill using the flag <B>-d </B>.  A flowline stops if its next
segment would reverse the direction of flow (from up to down or vice-versa),
cross a barrier, or arrive at a cell with undefined elevation or aspect.
Another option, <B>skip </B>=<I>val </I>, indicates that only the flowlines
from every <I>val </I>th cell are to be included in <I>flout </I>.  The
default <B>skip </B> is 1. A high <B>skip </B> usually speeds up processing
time and often improves the readability of a visualization of <I>flout </I>.

<P>
 <P>
Flowpath length output <I>flout </I> gives the 
horizontal length of the flowline for given grid cell in units defined 
by your mapset. It is computed as the sum of the planar length of all straight 
flowline segments.   <P>
Flowline density output <I>dsout </I> represents the number 
of generated flowlines passing through the given cell. This program uses 
a modified multiple directions algorithm. Flowline density for each flowline 
passing between 2 grid cell centers is   fractioned between these grid 
cells by distance. This algorithm smoothes  flowline densities on convex 
(dispersing) slopes. Flowline lengths and densities can be computed for 
both uphill and downhill directionss. <P>
  
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
The user can run this program 
either interactively or non-interactively. The program will be run non-interactively 
if the user specifies program arguments and flag settings on the command 
line using the form: <P>
 <blockquote><B>r.flowmd </B> [<B>-d </B>] <B>elevin=name </B> <B>aspin=name </B> [<B>barrierin=name<B>] 
[<B>skip=val </B></B></B>] [<B>flout=name </B>] [<B>lgout=name </B>] [<B>dsout=name </B>] <P>
  </blockquote>
<P>
Alternately, the 
user can simply type <B>r.flowmd </B> on the command line without program arguments. 
 In this case, the user will be prompted for parameter values and flag 
settings using the standard GRASS parser interface. <P>

<H2>Algorithm background</H2> 

<P>1. Construction of flow-lines (slope-lines): r.flow uses an original
vector-grid algorithm which uses an infinite number of directions between
0.0000... and 360.0000...  and traces the flow as a line (vector) in the
direction of gradient (rather than from cell to cell in one of the 8
directions = D-infinity algorithm). They are traced in any direction using
aspect (so there is no limitation to 8 directions here). The D8 algorithm
produces zig-zag lines. The value in the outlet is very similar for both
r.flowmd and <a href=r.flow.html>r.flow</a> algorithms (because it is
essentially the watershed area), however the spatial distribution of flow,
especially on hillslopes is quite different. It is still a 1D flow routing
so the dispersal flow is not accurately described, but still better than D8.

<P>2. Computation of contributing areas: r.flowmd divides this flow
proportionally to two downslope adjacent cells using the distance between
the intersection node (flowline node) and these adjacent cell centres. (All
these three points are always on one connection line).  Therefore r.flowmd
uses a multiple flow algorithm but using a flux decomposition different from
Desmet &amp; Govers (1996). D. & G. split the flux vector to two ordinal
components (cells) using sin, cos of the aspect value. The flux is then
divided to 2 from 4 neighboring cardinal cells.  The algorithm used in
r.flowmd divides the flux to two adjacent downslope cells (always one
cardinal and one diagonal cell) using a procedure as described above.

  
<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>
 Flowlines generated uphill are used 
for computation of the flowpath length (slope lenghts) defining the distance 
between the grid cell   and upland area.  This can be used, for example, 
in water erosion modeling for the computation of LS factor in standard 
form of USLE. Flowlines can be also generated downhill from each grid point 
to simulate the topographic potential for quasi steady-state overland water 
flow. Downslope flowline density multiplied by grid cell area gives the 
upslope contributing  area.  This topographic parameter  defines an area 
from which water  inflows to the given cell. This area is an estimate of 
potential steady-state water flux and can be used in the modeling of water 
erosion and for computation of unit stream power based LS factor. The program 
has been designed for modeling erosion on hillslopes and has a very strict 
condition for ending the flowline. It is therefore not very suitable for 
the extraction of stream network or delineation of watersheds unless a 
DEM without pits or flat areas is available
(<a href=r.fill.dir.html>r.fill.dir</a> can be used to fill pits). <P>

<P> To label the vector flowlines automatically, the user can use
<a href=v.llabel.html>v.llabel</a>.

<H2>FURTHER NOTES</H2>

Differences between <em>r.flow</em> and <em>r.flowmd</em>
<p>

<ol>

<li> r.flow has an option to compute slope and aspect internally thus making
the program capable to process much larger data sets than r.flowmd. It has
also 2 additional options for handling of large data sets but it is not
known that they work properly.
<li> the programs handle the special cases when the flowline passes exactly
(or very close) through the grid vertices differently.
<li> r.flowmd has the simplified multiple flow addition so the results are
smoother.
</ol>

In conclusion, <em>r.flowmd</em> produces nicer results but is slower and it
do support as large data sets as <em>r.flow</em>.
