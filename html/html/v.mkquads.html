<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.mkquads</b></EM>  - Creates a GRASS vector map layer 
and/or sites list 
and/or geographic region definition file 
for a USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.mkquads</B>
<BR>
<B>v.mkquads help</B>

<B>v.mkquads</B> [<B>-esrvx</B>] <B>map=</B><EM>name</EM>
[<B>type=</B><EM>quad size</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

There are three types of output available from the GRASS 
program <EM>v.mkquads</EM>: 
<OL>
<LI>a vector map of all the full USGS quadrangles that will fit within the 
boundaries of the current geographic region. 
<LI>a GRASS sites list containing the corner coordinates of 
each of these quads. 
<LI>GRASS geographic region definition files 
associated with each of the quads created. 
</OL>

<P>

A <EM>quad</EM> is defined as the area covered by a USGS
7.5-minute (1:24,000) map.  This program is useful for
managing a GRASS data base LOCATION which contains a number
of quads which are to be patched together.

<P>

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-e</B>
<DD>Encompass current geographic region with quads 
    (rather than only creating those quads that lie inside of 
    the geographic region). 
    Use of this option will affect all output options. 
<DT><B>-s</B>
<DD>Create a GRASS sites list file. 
    The sites list will contain all the corner coordinates of all the 
    full quads that can be built in the current geographic region. 
    The sites list file can then be displayed using the 
    <EM><A HREF="d.sites.html">d.sites</A></EM> 
    program. 
<DT><B>-r</B>
<DD>Create region file(s): quad.1 quad.2 ... 
    The program will generate a separate geographic region
    definition file for each quad; each of the geographic
    region files created will have the prefix <EM>quad.</EM>
    with some number attached to it.  For example, if only one
    quad were created, the geographic region file
    <EM>quad.1</EM> would also be created in the
    <EM>windows</EM> directory under the user's current
    mapset.  To make the program-generated geographic region
    definition file <EM>quad.1</EM> your <EM>current</EM>
    geographic region setting, run the GRASS 
    <EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM> program.

<DT><B>-v</B>
<DD>Create vector file (default). 
    Only full quads will be created.  The binary vector map
    layer output is placed under the user's <EM>dig</EM>
    directory and can be used like any other vector map layer.
    Run <EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> to
    build the topology information for the vector map before
    using <EM>v.mkquads</EM> map layer outputs in the 
    <EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM> program.  Since
    the quads are computer-generated, the corner coordinates
    will be exact.  This simplifies digitizing if one or more
    quad sheets will have to be brought together for a data
    base, because all of the quad corner points to be joined
    will be guaranteed to match.

<DT><B>-x</B>
<DD>Create a GRASS registration (<EM>reg</EM>) file. 
</DL>

<P>
<H3>Parameter:</H3> 
<DL>
<DT><B>map=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The name of a file to contain program output. 
<DT><B>type=</B><EM>quad size</EM></DT>
<DD>options: full,third,quarter,1x1,1x2<BR>
default: full</DD>
</DL>

<P>

If the user runs <EM>v.mkquads</EM> without including
program parameter value and desired flags on the command
line, the program will prompt the user for the above
information using the standard GRASS interface described in
the manual entry for 
<EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></EM>.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

All output options can be used on the command line at the
same time.  A listing of all the quad points in
latitude/longitude and projected coordinates will be displayed
each time the program is executed.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

There are no guarantees that <EM>v.mkquads</EM>
will function properly if a quadrangle crosses UTM zones.
This program has not been tested outside the northwest UTM
quadrant.
