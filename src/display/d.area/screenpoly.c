/* @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ *
 * NOTES:
 * The ScreenPoly routine incur some overhead, so one should consider if the
 * functionality is really useful.  In general, if you can pretty accurately
 * estimate how big of a SCREENPOLY you will need, things will work better.
 * 
 * Since this implementation uses pointers to a sequential array, some 
 * operations have to duplicate or generate a whole new SCREENPOLY in order
 * to keep the pointers correct.  Some initial testing showed having each
 * point malloc'ed or free'ed as needed incurred more overhead than doing
 * fewer big malloc's or free's.  The down side is it is harder to resize
 * the data without incurring larger memory usage (at least temporarily).
 * If the list data was much larger than the SCREENPOINT, then it would
 * probably be more efficient to use as needed allocation/deallocation
 * and some operations could be simplified.
 *
 * SCREENPOLY's will never shrink in size automatically, but will grow as
 * needed.  If one does alot of deletions, it may save some memory to do a
 * ScreenPolyCopy() into a more appropriately sized SCREENPOLY.  However,
 * you must weigh this against the extra (temporary) memory usage and copying
 * overhead that will be incurred.
