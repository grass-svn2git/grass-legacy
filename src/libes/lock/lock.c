/******************************************************************
* lock_file (file,pid)
*   char *file
*
*   this routine "locks" the file for process pid as follows:
*
*   1. if file exists, the old pid is read out of the file.
*
*      if the old pid and the new pid are the same, then
*      nothing more is done and the request is successful.
*
*      if this the old pid process is still running, the file is
*      considered locked.
*
*   2. if file does not exist, or if file exists but process is not
*      running (ie, lock was not removed), the file is locked for
*      process pid by writing pid into the file.
*
*
* note: since file is created by this routine, it shouldn't be
*       a file that is used for any other purpose.
*
*       also, this lock mechanism is advisory. programs must call this
*       routine and check the return status.
*
* returns:
*       1 ok lock is in place.
*       0 could not lock because another process has the file locked already
*      -1 error. could not create the lock file
*      -2 error. could not read the lock file.
*      -3 error. could not write the lock file.

/*!
 * \brief create a lock
 *
 * This routine
 * decides if the lock can be set and, if so, sets the lock. If <b>file</b>
 * does not exist, the lock is set by creating the file and writing the
 * <b>pid</b> (process id) into the <b>file.</b> If <b>file</b> exists, the
 * lock may still be active, or it may have been abandoned. To determine this, an
 * integer is read out of the file. This integer is taken to be the process id
 * for the process which created the lock. If this process is still running, the
 * lock is still active and the lock request is denied. Otherwise the lock is
 * considered to have been abandoned, and the lock is set by writing the
 * <b>pid</b> into the <b>file.</b>
 * Return codes:
 * 1 ok, lock request was successful
 * 0 sorry, another process already has the file locked
 * -1 error. could not create the file
 * -2 error. could not read the file
 * -3 error. could not write the file
