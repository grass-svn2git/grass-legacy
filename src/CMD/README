The files BRANCH, LASTRELEASE and RELEASE can be used for changelog
generation (`make ChangeLog' from the build directory when using the alternate
build mechanism).

BRANCH should contain the current CVS branch, either TRUNK for the main branch 
or something like releasebranch_26_april_2002_5_0_0 etc.

LASTRELEASE should contain the tag of the last release made from this branch, 
i.e. this is what the ChangeLog will be 'diffed' against. The last release
from the TRUNK prior to 5.3.0 was 5.0.0 beta 11.

RELEASE should either contain a tag, e.g. release_03_11_2003_grass5_0_3, or
if the new release has not been made yet then the name of the branch (as in
BRANCH). For the TRUNK put either MAIN or HEAD here (either will work);
if another branch is being followed then there is no such
thing as HEAD and the name of the branch will work instead.

Example (prior to the 5.3.0 release---log of ongoing changes since the last 
release from the MAIN branch):
BRANCH:
       TRUNK
LASTRELEASE:
       release_grass5beta11_4_february_2001
RELEASE:
       HEAD

When the release is made (i.e. Changelog between the last release from the
TRUNK and the newest one):
BRANCH:
       TRUNK
LASTRELEASE:
       release_grass5beta11_4_february_2001
RELEASE:
       release_??_02_2003_grass5_3_0

Another example (to give a changelog between 5.0.2 and 5.0.3):

BRANCH:
       releasebranch_26_april_2002_5_0_0
LASTRELEASE:
       release_10_04_2003_grass5_0_2
RELEASE:
       release_03_11_2003_grass5_0_3

And a final one (to give a log of the changes on the 5.0 release branch
since the 5.0.3 release):
BRANCH:
       releasebranch_26_april_2002_5_0_0
LASTRELEASE:
       release_03_11_2003_grass5_0_3
RELEASE:
       releasebranch_26_april_2002_5_0_0
