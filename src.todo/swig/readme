INTRO

The beginnings of a Swig binding to the grass libraries with
a view to allowing TCL and other languages access to Grass
and possibly to build an entire OS independent GUI based
on some such.

Using MinGW32 gcc 3.2.2 and SWIG 1.3.19 the size of the libgis binding DLL
is approx 1.5 Mb


WINDOWS

MinGW32 

Ensure that libz.dll and oncprc.dll are in your path as libgis.dll depends
on them.
